A year later, Mike Cadoo joined up, and the duo released their first two demos, Sickness and Frozen, and soon signed to [[Pendragon Records]] in 1997.\n\nTheir style was originally akin to the sound of [[Skinny Puppy]] with less vocals and an ambient aspect not normally found in [[industrial music|industrial]] at the time. Eventually, they took on more and more [[ambient music|ambient]] and futuristic electronic sounds and slowly lessened their industrial edge whilst removing any trace of vocals.\n\nOn March 24, 2005, the band announced its dissolution on its website, but promised to continue making music under Wells' and Cadoo's respective [[side projects]]. Their last recorded material to be released was two tracks on the 2006 [[Hymen Records]] compilation ''Travel Sickness''.\n\n==Discography==\n\n=== Full Length Albums and EPs ===\n* ''Sickness (Demo)'' ([[1995 in music|1995]])\n* ''Frozen (Demo)'' ([[1996 in music|1996]])\n* ''The Synthetic Form'' [[Pendragon Records|Pendragon]] ([[1997 in music|1997]])\n* ''Enzyme EP'' ([[1998 in music|1998]])\n* ''Further'' [[Pendragon Records|Pendragon]] ([[1999 in music|1999]])\n* ''5.25 (Limited edition)'' [[Pendragon Records|Pendragon]] ([[2000 in music|2000]])\n* ''Trace'' Unit ([[2001 in music|2001]])\n* ''Formless'' [[Hymen Records|Hymen]] ([[2003 in music|2003]])\n\n=== Singles & Vinyl EPs ===\n* ''Gridlock / O2 - 366115\" Unit\n* ''Engram 12\"'' Hymen\n* ''Gridlock / Steel'' split 12\" Klangkrieg\n* ''Gridlock / Panacea'' split 12\" Component\n* ''Under'' 3\" CD Piehead\n* ''Gridlock / Blood\n\n=== Special Releases ===\n* ''live.traces'' self-released\n* ''Trace'' 12\" Zod\n* ''Formless'' 2x12\" Hymen\n\n===Compilations===\n* ''The Tyranny Off the Beat Vol. 4'' CD (Off Beat 1997)\n* ''Exoskeleton CD'' (Possessive Blindfold 1998)\n* ''Binary Application Extension 05'' CD (Culture Shock 1998)\n* ''The Tyranny Off the Beat Vol. 5'' CD (Off Beat 1998)\n* ''Classix'' CD (Off Beat 1999)\n* ''The Flatline Compilation 2'' CD (Flatline 1999)\n* ''Virion Sequences'' CD (Gashed 2000)\n* ''Exoskeleton 3'' CD (Possessive Blindfold 2001)\n* ''Masonic'' CD (Hymen 2002)\n* ''Sub.Session'' CD (Sub.Session 2002)\n* ''Zod 07'' 12\" (Zod 2002)\n* ''Bitmapping'' CD (Objective/Subjective 2003)\n* ''Hybrid Components'' CD (Component 2003)\n* ''Travel Sickness'' CD (Hymen 2006)\n\n===Remixes===\n* Cherised Agony on ''Evolution'' by [[Android Lust]]\n* LP1 on ''Corruption Time'' by Neutronic\n* Payoff on ''Truthead'' by Aghast View\n* Unforgiven on ''Unburied'' by Allied Vision\n* As Death Approaches on ''Inception of Eradication'' by Holocaust Theory\n* My Saviour on ''Redemption EP'' by [[Flesh Field]]\n* In Memorial on ''WWW'' by Individual Totem\n* Wraith on ''Moon_Phase'' by [[Displacer (band)]]\n* One Man And His Anger on ''The Connected Series #4'' by Steel\n* J.
