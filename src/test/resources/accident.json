On March 10, 1967, it crashed shortly after takeoff at Klamath Falls, killing all four aboard.\n\n== Synopsis ==\n\nWest Coast Airlines Flight 720 was operated on March 10, 1967 by one of the company's Fokker F-27's, registered N2712.  On the morning of the flight, the aircraft was parked in West Coast's hangar at the airport for routine maintenance.<ref name=\"aird\">[http://www.airdisaster.com/reports/ntsb/AAR68-AD.pdf ]{{dead link|date=January 2018}}</ref>  Due to the falling snow that morning, instead of loading at the terminal, as was standard procedure, the aircraft was loaded in the hangar with the passenger and crew members.  Both pilots did a pre-flight check of the plane, and reported nothing unusual.  \n\nOnce boarding was completed at 4:46 AM, the plane was pushed out of the hangar.   Snow mixed with rain was falling.<ref name=\"aird\" />  During push back from the hangar, the tractor tug was observed to have gotten stuck in the snow, and ground personnel spent 11 minutes freeing it, during which time the airplane was exposed to the weather.  No attempt was made to clear the wings or control surfaces of snow.  Once freed from the snow, the aircraft taxied to Runway 14 and was given takeoff clearance at 4:57 AM.\n\nThe aircraft took off at 5:01 AM, and at 5:02:43 the flight contacted the tower to check if they were on radar.   This was the last communication from the aircraft.\n\nThe controller reported to Flight 720 that they were on radar.  The controller witnessed a target on his screen drift to the left of the runway centerline and head towards [[Stukel Mountain]] 6 miles from the airport.  At 5:02:49 the flight impacted Stukel Mountain, after failing to get airborne high enough to clear the mountain.<ref name=\"aird\" />\n\n== Cause and investigation ==\n\nAt 5:09 AM a report came into the tower that an aircraft had crashed on Stukel Mountain.  It was observed that the runway tracks were in heavy snow, and the plane swerved to the left on the runway before becoming airborne.  By takeoff, the left gear was 12 feet off the runway.<ref name=\"aird\" />  \n\nSeveral witnesses in the vicinity saw the airplane flying low, followed by seeing or hearing a large explosion.  All reported snow at the time of the crash.<ref>Klamath Falls, OR West Coast Airline Plane Crashes, Mar 1967  http://www3.gendisasters.com/node/3623</ref>\n\nThe aircraft was equipped with a flight data recorder.  Although damaged in the crash, the recording medium was able to be read.  The aircraft was reported to have climbed to approximately 1 minute after takeoff.   Throughout the flight the aircraft was recorded to have continued a turn to the left of the assigned heading.  Shortly before impact the aircraft began a sharp turn to the left, towards the mountain, at heading of 042 degrees.  \n\nThe aircraft was equipped with a [[cockpit voice recorder]], which, although damaged, was able to be read. The crew reported a loss of control before impact, along with a report of not being able to see the mountain.  An expletive was uttered right before impact.<ref name=\"aird\" />  \n\nThe aircraft was observed to have been accumulating ice and snow on its control surfaces prior to takeoff and when moved out of the hangar.  No action was taken by the crew to have the aircraft deiced, and it was believed by the investigation that this was responsible for the accident.<ref>http://www.planecrashinfo.com/1967/1967-20.htm</ref>  Due to the crew's short turnaround schedule, fatigue was suggested as a contributing factor in the accident.\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n{{Aviation accidents and incidents in 1967}}\n\n[[Category:Aviation accidents and incidents in the United States in 1967]]\n[[Category:1967 in Oregon]]\n[[Category:Airliner accidents and incidents in Oregon]]\n[[Category:West Coast Airlines accidents and incidents]]\n[[Category:Disasters in Oregon]]\n[[Category:Transportation in Klamath County, Oregon]]\n[[Category:March 1967 events]]"

Their 22-year-old [[bus]] had already been travelling for ten hours when [[police]] say it apparently developed a fault, probably with its brakes. The bus was descending a highway on a steep hill at over 70 miles per hour. The driver attempted to manoeuvre into an emergency [[hard shoulder]] but lost control, sending the bus rolling down a ravine which bordered the road.  \n\nThe bus fell approximately 650 feet into the stream bed below, crashing into the hillside several times as it descended. The bus was well over its capacity of 46, carrying at least 60 passengers. 57 of those were killed in the impact, and the three survivors were all very seriously injured. Initial reports said that there had been 71 passengers on the bus and 63 had died, but these numbers were scaled back as bodies were identified and several critically injured people died in the rescue operation.\n\nThe police believe that the bus's brakes were faulty, having not been serviced properly in many years, and that the driver was driving much too fast for the dangerous road, which is a well known accident black spot, owing to the lack of [[crash barrier]]s. The owner of the company which supplied the bus was taken in for questioning by Mexican police.\n\n== See also ==\n\n* [[List of road accidents]]\n\n== External links ==\n*[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/americas/4917256.stm BBC News Report]\n*[https://www.usatoday.com/news/world/2006-04-17-mexico-bus-crash_x.htm USA Today News Report]\n\n{{coord missing|Mexico}}\n\n[[Category:Bus incidents in Mexico]]\n[[Category:2006 road incidents]]\n[[Category:2006 in Mexico]]\n[[Category:April 2006 events]]"

The cause was ascribed to loss of flight control due to explosive decompression and structural failure. The accident marked the second operational loss and first fatal crash for the C-5 Galaxy fleet, and is the deadliest accident involving a U.S. military aircraft.{{Citation needed|date=October 2010}}\n\n== Background ==\nEarly in April 1975 with much of South Vietnam overrun by [[North Vietnam]]ese forces, the administration of US President [[Gerald Ford]] began instituting the evacuation of American citizens. To avoid alarming the host country, U.S. Ambassador to South Vietnam [[Graham Martin]] authorized Americans to be flown out under several conditions, one of which was [[Operation Babylift]], in which American caregivers were paired with South [[Vietnamese people|Vietnamese]] orphans, most of them fathered by American servicemen.<ref>''Nixon, Ford, and the Abandonment of South Vietnam'', J. Edward Lee and Toby Haynsworth, McFarland and Company, {{ISBN|0-7864-1302-6}}, 2002.</ref>\n\n== Description ==\nOn the afternoon of Friday, 4 April 1975, C-5A, AF Ser. No. 68-0218, making the first flight of Operation Babylift, departed Tan Son Nhut Air Base for [[Clark Air Base]] in the [[Republic of the Philippines|Philippines]]. This first group of orphans would then transfer to charter flights and be welcomed by President Ford upon arriving in the United States at San Diego, California. At 4:15&nbsp;p.m. the C-5A was over the [[South China Sea]] about {{convert|13|nmi|km}} off [[Vũng Tàu]],<ref name=\"babylift\" /> South Vietnam, flying a heading of 136 degrees and climbing to an altitude of {{convert|23000|ft|sigfig=3|abbr=on}}. At that moment the locks on the rear loading ramp failed, causing the cargo door to open explosively. This caused [[explosive decompression]], temporarily filling the cabin with a whirlwind of fog and debris. The blowout severed control cables to the tail, causing two of four hydraulic systems to fail, including those for the rudder and elevator,<ref name=\"LastFlight\"/> and leaving the flight control with only the use of one [[aileron]], [[Spoiler (aeronautics)|spoilers]], and power.\n\nThe pilot, [[Captain (United States O-3)|Captain]] Dennis \"Bud\" Traynor, and copilot, Captain Tilford Harp, attempted to regain control of the airplane, and to perform a 180&nbsp;degree turn in order to return to Tan Son Nhut.<ref>[http://www.airforce-magazine.com/MagazineArchive/Pages/1991/August%201991/0891valor.aspx Valor: A Galaxy of Heroes], Air Force Magazine, August 1991.</ref> The aircraft began to exhibit [[phugoid]] oscillations, but the crew countered them and maintained a controlled descent of about {{convert|250|to|260|kn|km/h|lk=in}}. They were able to bring the plane to {{convert|4000|ft|sigfig=3|abbr=on}} and begin the approach to Tan Son Nhut's runway 25L. While turning on final approach, the plane's descent rate suddenly began to increase rapidly.  The crew increased power to the engines in an attempt to arrest the descent, but despite their efforts, the plane touched down at 4:45&nbsp;p.m. in a rice paddy, and skidded for a quarter of a mile (400&nbsp;m), became airborne again for another half-mile (800&nbsp;m), crossing the [[Saigon River]], then hit a dike and broke up into four pieces. The fuel caught fire and some of the wreckage was set ablaze.\n\nSurvivors struggled to extricate themselves from the wreckage. The crash site was in a muddy rice paddy near the Saigon River, one mile (1.6&nbsp;km) from the nearest road. Fire engines could not reach the site, and helicopters had to set down some distance from the wreckage. About 100 South Vietnamese soldiers deployed around the site, which was near the site of an engagement with the [[Viet Cong]] the previous night. Out of 328 people on board, the death toll included 78 children, 35 [[Military Assistance Command, Vietnam#Defence Attaché Office|Defence Attaché Office]] employees and 11 U.S. Air Force personnel; there were 173 survivors.<ref name=\"LastFlight\">{{cite journal|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=TmSApdkHyWIC|page=29|title=Last Flight From Saigon|publisher=Diane Publishing|isbn=1-4289-8211-6|volume=IV|journal=USAF Southeast Asia Monograph Series}}</ref> All of the surviving orphans were eventually flown to the United States.

The [[United States Navy]] [[amphibious cargo ship]] {{USS|Durham|LKA-114}}, [[frigate]] {{USS|Reasoner|FF-1063}}, and [[command ship]] {{USS|Blue Ridge|LCC-19}} were assigned to search for the flight data recorder in the South China Sea.<ref name=\"babylift\" /> The recorder was found, and U.S. Navy ships and helicopters also discovered wreckage from the doors in the South China Sea as well as the body of a C-5 crewmember.<ref name=\"babylift\" />\n\nWhen the rear doors were eventually recovered from the sea, investigation determined that some of the locks had not engaged properly. Maintenance records showed that locks had been cannibalized for spares, then subsequently improperly refitted so that not all the door locks were engaging correctly. Furthermore, the flight crew confirmed that they had encountered difficulty closing the doors before take-off. As the air pressure differential increased with altitude, the few locks that were working correctly were unable to bear the load, and the door failed.<ref>[https://aviation-safety.net/database/record.php?id=19750404-0 Lockheed C-5A Galaxy Accident description] Aviation Safety Network 16 September 2017</ref>\n\n==Dramatization==\nThe story of the disaster was featured on the seventh season of the [[Cineflex|Canadian made]], internationally distributed documentary series ''[[Mayday (Canadian TV series)|Mayday]]'', in the episode [[List of Mayday episodes#ep53|\"Operation Babylift\"]].<!--- various countries use various series and episode names, which is fully and properly covered at the links -->\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Vietnam|Aviation|Disasters|United States Air Force|1970s}}\n*[[Turkish Airlines Flight 981]]\n*[[Japan Airlines Flight 123]]\n*[[United Airlines Flight 232]]\n*[[United Airlines Flight 811]]\n*[[American Airlines Flight 96]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{Reflist|group=\"Notes\"}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* [http://www.facebook.com/group.php?gid=31158998509&v=wall C-5A Galaxy BABYLIFT Crash] – Facebook group operated by Dennis Traynor, aircraft commander during the 1975 incident.\n* [http://airlift-tanker-association.s3.amazonaws.com/atq/ATQ_Spring_2005.pdf First-Person Account – Pilot Dennis “Bud” Traynor] Page 6\n* [http://airlift-tanker-association.s3.amazonaws.com/atq/ATQ_Fall_2005.pdf World Airways – Homeward Bound – 30 Years After] Page 44 (pdf page 34)\n\n{{Aviation accidents and incidents in 1975}}\n{{Coord|10|50|25|N|106|41|51|E|region:VN_type:event|display=title}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Tan Son Nhut C-5 Accident}}\n[[Category:Aviation accidents and incidents in Vietnam]]\n[[Category:Accidents and incidents involving United States Air Force aircraft]]\n[[Category:Accidents and incidents involving the Lockheed C-5 Galaxy]]\n[[Category:Aviation accidents and incidents in 1975]]\n[[Category:1975 in Vietnam]]\n[[Category:Decompression accidents and incidents]]\n[[Category:History of South Vietnam]]\n[[Category:April 1975 events]]"

After being switched over to the tower [[air traffic controller|controller]], SkyWest was cleared to land on runway 28R. At the same time, the Republic Airlines aircraft, bound for [[Los Angeles]], California was instructed to taxi into position and hold for two minutes before takeoff clearance was also granted on the intersecting runway 1L. As the landing SkyWest aircraft passed the [[Visual runways|runway threshold]] the Republic Airlines aircraft was cleared for takeoff.<ref name=\"ntsb initial\"/> Local procedures and [[FAA Order 7110.65]] require the [[local controller]] to wait until the landing aircraft has passed through the intersection before clearing an aircraft for takeoff on one of the intersecting runways.\n\nApproximately 27&nbsp;seconds later the [[Airport Movement Area Safety System]] (AMASS) issued an aural warning of an imminent collision, and the [[Air traffic controller|local controller]] instructed the SkyWest aircraft to stop, transmitting, \"uh, sky-, skywest uhh fifty seven forty one HOLD HOLD HOLD\". The SkyWest aircraft came to a stop in the intersection of runways 1L and 28R, while Republic Airlines flight lifted off and overflew it.
