Following the end of the [[Napoleonic Wars]], in August 1815 Captain [[John Pasco]] was given command of HMS ''Lee'' and was employed in the [[English Channel]] for the suppression of smuggling. He remained her captain until ''Lee'' was [[Ship commissioning#Ship decommissioning|paid off]] in September 1818. ''Lee'' was retained in [[Reserve Fleet (United Kingdom)|ordinary]] for another four years before she was sold for breaking up in May 1822.\n\n==References==\n*{{Colledge}}\n*Rif Winfield, ''British Warships in the Age of Sail 1793-1817: Design, Construction, Careers and Fates''. 2nd edition, Seaforth Publishing, 2008. {{ISBN|978-1-84415-717-4}}.\n\n{{Cyrus class post ship}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Lee (1814)}}\n[[Category:Cyrus-class post ships]]\n[[Category:Medway-built ships]]\n[[Category:1814 ships]]"
