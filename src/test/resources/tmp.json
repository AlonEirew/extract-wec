The 1978 festival featured films such as ''[[Deliverance]]'', ''[[A Streetcar Named Desire (1951 film)|A Streetcar Named Desire]]'', ''[[Midnight Cowboy]]'', ''[[Mean Streets]]'', and ''[[The Sweet Smell of Success]]''.<ref>{{cite web\n|work=Sundance-A Festival Virgin's Guide\n|title=History of the Sundance Film Festival\n|url=http://www.sundanceguide.net/basics/history\n|last=Craig\n|first=Benjamin\n|accessdate=2012-10-08\n}}</ref>\nWith chairman [[Robert Redford]], and the help of Utah Governor [[Scott M. Matheson (Utah governor)|Scott M. Matheson]], the goal of the festival was to showcase strictly American-made films, highlight the potential of independent film, and to increase visibility for filmmaking in Utah. At the time, the main focus of the event was to conduct a competition for independent American films, present a series of retrospective films and filmmaker panel discussions, and to celebrate the [[Frank Capra]] Award. The festival also highlighted the work of regional filmmakers who worked outside the [[Hollywood]] system.\n\nThe jury of the 1978 festival was headed by [[Charles Gary Allison|Gary Allison]], and included [[Verna Fields]], [[Linwood G. Dunn]], [[Katharine Ross]], [[Charles Sellier|Charles E. Sellier Jr.]], [[Mark Rydell]], and [[Anthea Sylbert]].\n\nIn 1979, Sterling Van Wagenen left to head up the first-year pilot program of what was to become the [[Sundance Institute]], and James W. (Jim) Ure took over briefly as executive director, followed by Cirina Hampton Catania as executive director. More than 60 films were screened at the festival that year, and panels featured many well-known Hollywood filmmakers. Also that year, the first Frank Capra Award went to [[Jimmy Stewart]]. The festival also made a profit for the first time. In 1980, Catania left the festival to pursue a production career in Hollywood.\n\nSeveral factors helped propel the growth of Utah/US Film Festival. First was the involvement of actor and Utah resident Robert Redford, who became the festival's inaugural chairman. By having Redford's name associated with the festival, it received great attention. Secondly, the country was hungry for more venues that would celebrate American-made films as the only other festival doing so at the time was the [[USA Film Festival]] in [[Dallas]] (est. 1971). Response in Hollywood was unprecedented, as major studios did all they could to contribute their resources.\n\nIn 1981, the festival moved to Park City, Utah, and changed the dates from September to January. The move from late summer to midwinter was done by the executive director Susan Barrell with the cooperation of Hollywood director [[Sydney Pollack]], who suggested that running a film festival in a ski resort during winter would draw more attention from Hollywood. It was called the US Film and Video Festival.\n\n=== Change to Sundance ===\nIn 1984, the now well-established Sundance Institute, headed by Sterling Van Wagenen, took over management of the US Film Festival. Gary Beer and Van Wagenen spearheaded production of the inaugural US Film Festival presented by Sundance Institute (1985), which included Program Director Tony Safford and Administrative Director Jenny Walz Selby. The branding and marketing transition from the US Film Festival to the Sundance Film Festival was managed under the direction of Colleen Allen, Allen Advertising Inc., by appointment of Robert Redford.  In 1991, the festival was officially renamed the Sundance Film Festival, after Redford's character [[the Sundance Kid]] from the film ''[[Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid]]''.<ref>{{cite web |first=Lauren David |last=Peden |title=Sundance Subdued |url=http://www.coastmagazine.com/archive/pre_dec05/travel_sundance.html |date=December 2005 |publisher=Freedom Orange County Information (coastmagazine.com) |accessdate=2007-11-11 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927202623/http://www.coastmagazine.com/archive/pre_dec05/travel_sundance.html <!-- Bot retrieved archive --> |archivedate=2007-09-27}}</ref>\n\n===Sundance London===\n{{Update|inaccurate=yes|section|date=October 2012}}\nUK-based publisher C21 Media first revealed in October 2010 that Robert Redford was planning to bring the Sundance Film Festival to London,<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.c21media.net/archives/51050|title=Exclusive: Redford plans London Sundance|first=Adam|last=Benzine|newspaper=C21 Media|date=October 7, 2010|accessdate=May 29, 2013}}</ref> and in March the following year, Redford officially announced that Sundance London would be held at [[The O2]], in London from 26–29 April 2012; the first time it has traveled outside the [[United States|US]].<ref name=\"Farmer 2012\">{{cite news|url=http://www.theo2.co.uk/general/robert-redford-sundance-institute-and-aeg-europe-launch-sundance-at-t.html|title=Robert Redford, Sundance Institute And Aeg Europe Launch Sundance London At The O2|first=Stephen|last=Farmer|newspaper=[[AEG Worldwide]]|date=October 2012|accessdate=2012-10-22}}</ref>\n\nIn a press statement, Redford said, \"We are excited to partner with [[Anschutz Entertainment Group|AEG Europe]] to bring a particular slice of American culture to life in the inspired setting of The O2, and in this city of such rich cultural history.

Festival organizers have tried curbing these activities in recent years, beginning in 2007 with their ongoing Focus On Film campaign.\n\nThe 2009 film ''Official Rejection'' documented the experience of small filmmakers trying to get into various festivals in the late 2000s, including Sundance. The film contained several arguments that Sundance had become dominated by large studios and sponsoring corporations. A contrast was made between the 1990s, in which non-famous filmmakers with tiny budget films could get distribution deals from studios like [[Miramax Films]] or [[New Line Cinema]], (like [[Kevin Smith]]'s ''Clerks''), and the 2000s, when major stars with multimillion-dollar films (like ''The Butterfly Effect'' with [[Ashton Kutcher]]) dominated the festival. Kevin Smith doubted that ''Clerks'', if made in the late 2000s, would be accepted to Sundance.<ref>Kevin Smith, interviewed in ''Official Rejection'', documentary film, 2009, directed by Paul Osborne</ref>\n\nNumerous small festivals sprung up around Sundance in the Park City area, including [[Slamdance Film Festival|Slamdance]], [[Nodance Film Festival|Nodance]], [[Slumdance Film Festival|Slumdance]], It-dance, X-Dance, [[Lapdance]], [[Tromadance]], The [[Park City Film Music Festival]], etc., though all except{{citation needed|date=February 2017}} Slamdance are no longer held.<ref>''Official Rejection'', documentary film, 2009, directed by Paul Osborne</ref>\n\nIncluded in the Sundance changes made in 2010, a new programming category titled \"NEXT\" (often denoted simply by the characters \"<=>\", which mean \"less is more\") was introduced to showcase innovative films that are able to transcend the confines of an independent budget. Another recent addition was the Sundance Film Festival USA program, in which eight of the festival's films are shown in eight different theaters around the United States.<ref>{{cite news |date=January 22, 2010 |first=Cody |last=Clark |title=Redford launches 2010 Sundance Film Festival in Park City |url=http://heraldextra.com/news/local/article_38fab10a-0120-5c9a-bec2-b0c13dc56df8.html |newspaper=[[The Daily Herald (Utah)|The Daily Herald]] |accessdate=2010-01-22}}</ref>\n\n=== Directors ===\n* Geoff Gilmore – 1991–2009<ref>{{cite web\n|first=Jeremy\n|last=Kay\n|url=http://www.screendaily.com/john-cooper-steps-up-as-director-of-sundance-film-festival/4043584.article\n|title=John Cooper steps up as director of Sundance Film Festival\n|date=11 March 2009\n|publisher=ScreenDaily.com\n|accessdate=2010-01-31\n|subscription=yes\n}}</ref><ref>{{cite news\n|first=Michael\n|last=Cieply\n|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/02/18/movies/18tribeca.html\n|title=Shakeup in Film Festivals as a Familiar Face Moves\n|date=17 February 2009\n|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]\n|accessdate=2010-01-31\n}}</ref>\n* John Cooper – 2009–present<ref>\n{{cite press release\n|publisher=Sundance Institute\n|url=http://www.sundance.org/pdf/2009-03-09-cooper.pdf\n|format=pdf\n|title=Sundance Institute announces John Cooper as Director, Sundance Film Festival\n|date=11 March 2009\n|accessdate=2010-01-31\n}}</ref>\n\n== In popular culture ==\nIn August 1998, the animated television series ''[[South Park]]'' episode \"[[Chef's Chocolate Salty Balls]]\" depicts the directors of the Sundance Festival moving it to a \"different small mountain town,\" that of the show's main setting South Park, in order to \"drain it and morph it into a new [[Los Angeles|LA]].\"\n\nIn the episode \"[[Hollywood A.D.]]\" of [[X-Files|''The X-Files'']], [[Fox Mulder]] is relieved that the fictitious movie ''The Lazarus Bowl'' about his work will never be screened at the Sundance Festival.\n\nIn the television series ''[[Entourage (U.S. TV series)|Entourage]]'', one of the independent movies that [[Vincent Chase]] stars in (''Queens Boulevard'') premieres at the 2005 Sundance Film Festival, where it begins to gain in popularity.\n\nIn the animated television series ''[[The Simpsons]]'' \"[[Any Given Sundance]]\" episode, [[Lisa Simpson]] enters a documentary about her family into the Sundance Film Festival.\n\nIn Season 7, Episode 22 of ''[[One Tree Hill (TV series)|One Tree Hill]]'', [[List of One Tree Hill characters#Julian Baker|Julian Baker]] takes his film ''Seven Dreams Till Tuesday'' to the festival.\n\nReferenced in Season 3, Episode 12 of ''[[Gilmore Girls]]'' when [[Paris Geller]] tells [[Rory Gilmore]] to \"save her act for Sundance.\"\n\n== See also ==\n* [[List of Sundance Film Festival award winners]]\n* [[List of Sundance Film Festival selections]]\n* [[Sundance Channel (United States)|Sundance Channel]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n==Further reading==\n* Anderson, John.
