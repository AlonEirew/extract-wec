Armed with rifles and other weapons, they killed 12 people and injured 11 others. The gunmen identified themselves as belonging to the [[Islamist]] terrorist group [[Al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula|Al-Qaeda's branch in Yemen]], which took responsibility for the attack. [[January 2015 Île-de-France attacks|Several related attacks]] followed in the [[Île-de-France]] region, on 7-8 January 2015. On 9 January 2015 was the [[Hypercacher Kosher Supermarket siege]], where a terrorist murdered four Jewish hostages and held fifteen other hostages.\n\nFrance raised its [[Vigipirate]] terror alert and deployed soldiers in Île-de-France and [[Picardy]]. A major [[Manhunt (law enforcement)|manhunt]] led to the discovery of the suspects, who exchanged fire with police. The brothers took hostages at a signage company in [[Dammartin-en-Goële]] on 9 January and were shot dead when they emerged from the building firing.\n\nOn 11 January, about two million people, including more than 40 world leaders, met in Paris for a [[Republican marches|rally of national unity]], and 3.7 million people joined demonstrations across France. The phrase ''[[Je suis Charlie]]'' became a common slogan of support at the rallies and in social media. {{anchor|charlie-hebdo-issue-after-shooting}} The staff of ''Charlie Hebdo'' continued with the publication, and [[Charlie Hebdo issue No. 1178|the following issue]] print ran 7.95 million copies in six languages, compared to its typical print run of 60,000 in only French.\n\n==Background==\n\n===''Charlie Hebdo'' satirical works===\n{{Main article|Charlie Hebdo}}\n[[File:Charliehebdo.jpg|right|thumb|upright|alt=|3 November 2011 cover of ''Charlie Hebdo'', renamed ''[[Charia Hebdo]]'' (''Sharia Hebdo'').
