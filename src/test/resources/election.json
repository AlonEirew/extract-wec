It was held on Tuesday, November 6, 2012. The [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]] nominee, [[President of the United States|President]] [[Barack Obama]], and his [[running mate]], [[Vice President of the United States|Vice President]] [[Joe Biden]], were elected to a second term. They defeated the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] ticket of former [[Governor of Massachusetts|Governor]] [[Mitt Romney]] of [[Massachusetts]] and [[United States House of Representatives|Representative]] [[Paul Ryan]] of [[Wisconsin]].\n\nAs the incumbent president, Obama secured the Democratic nomination with no serious opposition. The Republicans experienced a [[Republican Party presidential primaries, 2012|competitive primary]]. Romney was consistently competitive in the polls and won the support of many party leaders, but he faced challenges from a number of more [[Conservatism in the United States|conservative]] contenders. Romney clinched his party's nomination in May, defeating [[Rick Santorum]], [[Newt Gingrich]], and several other candidates. \n\nThe campaigns focused heavily on domestic issues, and debate centered largely around sound responses to the [[Great Recession]]. Other issues included long-term [[United States federal budget|federal budget]] issues, the future of [[social insurance|social insurance programs]], and the [[Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act|Affordable Care Act]], Obama's marquee legislative program. [[Foreign policy]] was also discussed, including the phase-out of the [[Iraq War]], military spending, the [[Iran]]ian [[Nuclear program of Iran|nuclear program]], and appropriate counteractions to [[terrorism]]. The campaign was marked by a sharp rise in fundraising, including from nominally independent [[Super PACs]].\n\nObama defeated Romney, winning a majority of both the [[List of United States presidential elections by popular vote margin#Table of election results|popular vote]] and the [[Electoral College (United States)|Electoral College]]. Obama won 51.1% of the popular vote compared to Romney's 47.2%, while [[Libertarian Party (United States)|Libertarian]] nominee [[Gary Johnson]] won just under 1% of the vote. Obama was the first incumbent since [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] in [[United States presidential election, 1944|1944]] to win reelection with fewer electoral votes and a lower popular vote percentage than had been won in the previous election, and was also the first two-term president since [[Ronald Reagan]] to win both his presidential bids with a majority of the nationwide popular vote.\n\n==Timeline==\n[[File:Poll Closing Times 2008.svg|thumb|Final poll closing times on Election Day.\n{{legend|#D8BFD8|7 p.m. [[Eastern Time Zone|EST]] [00:00 [[Coordinated Universal Time|UTC]]] (6)}}\n{{legend|#EE82EE|7:30 p.m. EST [00:30 UTC] (3)}}\n{{legend|#BA55D3|8 p.m. EST [01:00 UTC] (15+DC)}}\n{{legend|#9932CC|8:30 p.m. EST [01:30 UTC] (1)}}\n{{legend|#8B008B|9 p.m. EST [02:00 UTC] (15)}}\n{{legend|#4B0082|10 p.m. EST [03:00 UTC] (4)}}\n{{legend|#483D8B|11 p.m. EST [04:00 UTC] (5)}}\n{{legend|#000000|1 a.m. EST [06:00 UTC] (1)}}]]\n* September–October 2012: Early voting begins in some states and continue as late as November 5.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.270towin.com/early-voting-2012-election/|title=Early Voting 2012 Presidential Election|accessdate=November 7, 2012}}</ref>\n* November 6, 2012: [[Election Day (United States)|Election Day]]; at around 11:15&nbsp;p.m. [[Eastern Standard Time (North America)|EST]], the networks call Ohio for Obama, projecting him the winner of the election.\n* November 7, 2012: Romney concedes the election to Obama at around 1:00&nbsp;a.m. [[Eastern Standard Time (North America)|EST]].\n* November 10, 2012: The electoral outcomes of all 50 states and the District of Columbia have been definitively projected (the electoral outcome in Florida remained uncertain until November 10).
