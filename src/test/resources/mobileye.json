Together with Ziv Aviram, he set up the company's [[R&D]] headquarters in Jerusalem, Israel.\n\nAt first, the company developed algorithms, and a [[AI accelerator (computer hardware)|custom accelerator processor chip]] called the ''EyeQ'' chip. All of Mobileye’s proprietary image processing algorithms run on the EyeQ chip. After years of testing, the chip and software algorithms began to be sold as commercial products to [[original equipment manufacturer]] (OEM) customers. The company’s first clients were [[automotive industry|automotive manufacturers]] such as BMW, General Motors and Volvo.
