The annual presentation ceremony features performances by prominent artists, and the presentation of those awards that have a more popular interest. It shares recognition of the music industry as that of the other performance awards such as the [[Academy Awards]] (film), the [[Emmy Award]]s (television), and the [[Tony Award]]s (theater).\n\nThe [[1st Annual Grammy Awards|first Grammy Awards ceremony]] was held on May 4, 1959, to honor and respect the musical accomplishments by performers for the year 1958. Following the 2011 ceremony, [[The Recording Academy|the Academy]] overhauled many Grammy Award categories for 2012. \n\nThe [[60th Annual Grammy Awards]], honoring the best achievements from October 1, 2016 to September 30, 2017 were held on January 28, 2018 at  [[Madison Square Garden]] in New York City.\n\n==History==\nThe Grammys had their origin in the [[Hollywood Walk of Fame]] project in the 1950s.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://projects.latimes.com/hollywood/star-walk/about/|title=Hollywood Walk of Fame History|work=Los Angeles Times|accessdate=May 21, 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.walkoffame.com/pages/history|title=Hollywood Walk of Fame History|publisher=Hollywood Walk of Fame|accessdate=May 21, 2011}}</ref> As the recording executives chosen for the Walk of Fame committee worked at compiling a list of important recording industry people who might qualify for a Walk of Fame star, they realized there were many more people who were leaders in their business who would never earn a star on [[Hollywood Boulevard]]. The music executives decided to rectify this by creating an award given by their industry similar to the [[Oscars]] and the [[Emmy Award|Emmys]]. This was the beginning of the [[National Academy of Recording Arts and Sciences]]. After it was decided to create such an award, there was still a question of what to call it; one working title was the Eddie, to honor the inventor of the phonograph, [[Thomas Edison]]. They finally settled on using the name of the invention of [[Emile Berliner]], the [[Phonograph|gramophone]], for the awards, which were first given for the year 1958.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=NnRPAAAAIBAJ&sjid=5wQEAAAAIBAJ&pg=1440,1446700&dq=paul+weston&hl=en|title=Record Academy Plans TV Spectacular of Its Own|author=Thomas, Bob|date=April 8, 1959|publisher=Ocala Star-Banner|accessdate=January 29, 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=ca9NAAAAIBAJ&sjid=cEgDAAAAIBAJ&pg=7065,1739274&dq=paul+weston&hl=en|title=Recording Stars Plan Eddie To Join Oscar And Emmy|date=August 9, 1957|publisher=The Deseret News|accessdate=February 2, 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=aSBAAAAAIBAJ&sjid=Z1gMAAAAIBAJ&pg=3612,4838071&dq=paul+weston+grammy&hl=en|title=Bronze Stars Begot Grammy|date=February 22, 1976|publisher=The Robesonian|accessdate=May 2, 2011}}</ref>\n\nThe [[1st Annual Grammy Awards|first award ceremony]] was held simultaneously in two locations on May 4, 1959 - Beverly Hilton Hotel in Beverly Hills California, and Park Sheraton Hotel in New York City,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.awardsandshows.com/features/grammy-awards-1959-may-238.html |title=Grammy Awards 1959 (May) |work=Grammy }}</ref> and 28 Grammys were awarded.

Special awards are given for longer-lasting contributions to the music industry.\n\nBecause of the large number of award categories (78 in 2012, 81 in 2013 and 82 in 2014), and the desire to feature several performances by various artists, only the ones with the most popular interest - typically about 10 to 12, including the four General Field categories and one or two categories in the most popular music genres (i.e. pop, rock, country, rap) - are presented directly at the televised award ceremony. The many other Grammy trophies are presented in a pre-telecast 'Premiere Ceremony' earlier in the afternoon before the Grammy Awards telecast.\n\n===2012 category restructuring===\n{{refimprove|section|date=May 2017}}\n\nOn April 6, 2011, The Recording Academy announced a drastic overhaul of many Grammy Award categories for 2012.<ref>[https://www.grammy.org/recording-academy/press-release/apr-06-2011-914-am Grammy.org, 6 June 2011]</ref> The number of categories was cut from 109 to 78. The most important change was the elimination of the distinction between male and female soloists and between collaborations and duo/groups in various genre fields (pop, rock, R&B, country, and rap). Also, several categories for instrumental soloists were discontinued. Recordings in these categories now fall under the general categories for best solo performances.\n\nIn the [[Rock music|rock]] field, the separate categories for hard rock and metal albums were combined and the [[Best Rock Instrumental Performance]] category was eliminated due to a waning number of entries.\n\nIn [[R&B]], the distinction between best contemporary R&B album and other R&B albums has been eliminated. They now feature in one, general [[Best R&B Album]] category.\n\nIn [[rap music|rap]], the categories for best rap soloist and best rap duo or group have been merged into the new [[Best Rap Performance]] category.\n\nThe most eliminations occurred in the [[American folk music|roots]] category. Up to and including 2011, there were separate categories for various regional American music forms, such as Hawaiian music, Native American music and Zydeco/Cajun music. Due to the consistently low number of entries for these categories, The Recording Academy decided to combine all these music variations into the new [[Best Regional Roots Music Album]], including [[polka]], which lost its own separate category in 2009.<ref name=CBC>{{cite news|publisher=[[CBC News]] |title=Grammy board axes polka category to stay 'relevant and responsive' |url=http://www.cbc.ca/arts/music/story/2009/06/04/grammy-changes-polka-ostanek.html?ref=rss |date=June 4, 2009 |accessdate=July 20, 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090610190520/http://www.cbc.ca/arts/music/story/2009/06/04/grammy-changes-polka-ostanek.html?ref=rss |archivedate=June 10, 2009 }}</ref><ref name=\"NYT090605\">{{cite news|first=Ben|last=Sisario|work=[[The New York Times]]|title=Polka Music Is Eliminated as Grammy Award Category |page=C5 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/06/05/arts/music/05polk.html|date=June 5, 2009 |accessdate=October 18, 2010 |publisher=[[The New York Times Company]]}}</ref>\n\nIn the same genre field, the traditional and contemporary blues categories and the traditional and contemporary folk categories each were consolidated into one per genre, due to the number of entries and given the challenges in distinguishing between contemporary folk and Americana, and contemporary and traditional blues. In the world music genre field, the traditional and contemporary categories also merged.\n\nIn the [[Classical music|classical]] genre field, its main category [[Best Classical Album]] was discontinued because most recipients in this category had also won in one of the other classical categories for the same album. Classical recordings are now eligible for the main [[Grammy Award for Album of the Year|Album of the Year]] category.\n\nThere were also a few minor name changes to better reflect the nature of the separate categories. It was determined by the Recording Academy that the word \"gospel\" in the [[Gospel music|gospel]] genre field tends to conjure up the images and sounds of traditional soul gospel and leaves out the current contemporary Christian music (CCM). Therefore, the genre field and some categories were renamed as Gospel/Contemporary Christian Music.<ref>[https://www.grammy.com/news/the-academy-continues-evolution-of-grammy-awards-process Grammy announcement, 6 April 2011]</ref>\n\nSince 2012, there have been a small number of adjustments made to the list of categories and genre fields. The number of categories has gone up from 78 in 2012 to 84 in 2017.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.grammy.com/grammys/news/60th-grammy-awards-full-nominees-list|title=See The Full List Of 60th GRAMMY Nominees|date=2017-11-27|work=GRAMMY.com|access-date=2017-12-08|language=en}}</ref>\n\n==Entry process and selection of nominees==\nMedia companies registered with the National Academy of Recording Arts and Sciences and individual members of NARAS (artists and other professionals working in the industry who meet certain criteria) may enter recordings for consideration. Entries are made online and a physical copy of the work is sent to NARAS. Once a work is entered, reviewing sessions are held, involving more than 150 experts from the recording industry, to determine whether the work is entered in the correct category.\n\nThe resulting lists of eligible entries are circulated to Voting Members, each of whom may vote to nominate in the general fields ([[Grammy Award for Record of the Year|Record of the Year]], [[Grammy Award for Album of the Year|Album of the Year]], [[Grammy Award for Song of the Year|Song of the Year]], and [[Grammy Award for Best New Artist|Best New Artist]]) and in no more than nine out of 30 other fields on their ballots. The five recordings that earn the most votes in each category become the nominees, while in some categories (craft and specialized categories) there are review committees in place that determine the final 5 nominees.<ref name=\"VotingProcess\">{{cite web | url=https://www.grammy.org/recording-academy/awards/grammy-awards-voting-process | title=Grammy Awards Voting Process | accessdate=January 17, 2014}}</ref> There may be more than five nominees if there is a tie in the nomination process.\n\nWhereas members of the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences are generally invited to screenings or are sent DVDs of films nominated for Oscars, NARAS members do not receive nominated recordings. Instead, they receive access to a private online listening function.\n\n==Final voting==\nAfter nominees have been determined, final voting ballots are sent to NARAS voting members, who may then vote in the general fields and in no more than nine of the 30 fields. Members are encouraged, but not required, to vote only in their fields of expertise. Ballots are tabulated secretly by the major independent accounting firm [[Deloitte Touche Tohmatsu]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.grammy.com/GRAMMY_Awards/Voting/ |title=Grammy Awards Voting Process |publisher=grammy com |accessdate=August 28, 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100820040650/https://www2.grammy.com/grammy_awards/voting/ |archivedate=August 20, 2010 |df=mdy-all }}</ref> Following the tabulation of votes the winners are announced at the Grammy Awards. The recording with the most votes in a category wins and it is possible to have a tie (in which case the two or more nominees who tie are all considered winners). Winners are presented with the Grammy Award and those who do not win are given a medal for their nomination.\n\nIn both voting rounds, Academy members are required to vote based upon quality alone, and not to be influenced by sales, chart performance, personal friendships, regional preferences or company loyalty. The acceptance of gifts is prohibited. Members are urged to vote in a manner that preserves the integrity of the Academy and their member community. Although registered media companies may submit entries they may not vote in either round of voting.\n\nThe eligibility period for the 60th Annual Grammy Awards was October 1, 2016 to September 30, 2017.\n\n==Special Awards==\n\n'''Salute To Industry Icons Award''' \n* [[Clive Davis]] (2009)\n\n* [[L.A.

Originally [[New York City]] and [[Los Angeles]] were the host cities. [[Chicago]] joined being a host city in 1962, and then [[Nashville]] became the fourth location in 1965.\n\nThe 1971 ceremony, held at the [[Hollywood Palladium]] in Los Angeles, was the first to take place in one location. The ceremony was then moved to [[Madison Square Garden]]'s [[Felt Forum]] in New York City, and then Nashville's [[Tennessee Theatre (Nashville)|Tennessee Theatre]] in the following two years. Then from 1974 to 2003, the Grammys were held in various venues in New York City and Los Angeles. Notable locations included New York City's Madison Square Garden and [[Radio City Music Hall]]; and Los Angeles's [[Shrine Auditorium]], the [[Staples Center]] and the Hollywood Palladium.\n\nIn 2004, the Staples Center became the permanent home of the award ceremonies. [[The Grammy Museum]] was built across the street from Staples Center in [[LA Live]] to preserve the history of the Grammy Awards. Embedded on the sidewalks at the museum streets are bronze disks, similar to the [[Hollywood Walk of Fame]], honoring each year's top winners, Record of the Year, Best New Artist, Album of the Year, and Song of the Year.

Unfortunately, the awards show has become a series of hypocrisies and contradictions, leaving me to question why any contemporary popular artist would even participate. [...] While there is no doubt in my mind of the artistic talents of [[Steely Dan]] or [[Herbie Hancock]], we must acknowledge the massive cultural impact of Eminem and Kanye West and how their music is shaping, influencing and defining the voice of a generation. It is this same cultural impact that acknowledged the commercial and critical success of [[Michael Jackson]]'s ''[[Thriller (Michael Jackson album)|Thriller]]'' in 1984.<ref name=\"Stoute\"/>}}The Grammys' eligibility period – which runs from October 1 to September 30 each year<ref>{{Cite web|title = FAQs|url = https://www.grammy.org/recording-academy/awards/voting-process/faqs#two|website = The GRAMMYs|access-date = February 16, 2016}}</ref> – is also a perennial source of complaints and confusion. Because records that are released in the last quarter of a given year are not eligible for that year's awards, fans often think a favorite artist has been snubbed (e.g., Adele, whose ''25'' was released in November 2015 and so was not nominated that year despite massive sales<ref>{{Cite web|title = Adele Grammys Snub: Why Wasn't She Nominated for 2016 Awards for '25'|url = http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/adele-grammys-snub-why-wasnt-846425|website = The Hollywood Reporter|access-date = February 16, 2016}}</ref>). Conversely, the same issue means that the Grammys often recognize work that no longer feels current by the time it wins. Taylor Swift's ''1989'', for example, won Album of the Year in 2016, even though the album was released in October 2014. The same was the case with [[Adele]]’s [[25 (Adele album)|25]]. It was released in November 2015 but received the award in 2017.<ref>{{Cite web|title = The Truth Behind This Year's Maddening Grammy Nominations|url = https://www.buzzfeed.com/brianmcmanus/the-truth-behind-this-years-maddening-grammy-nominations#.qyONGwObxO|website = BuzzFeed|access-date = February 16, 2016}}</ref>\n\nThe Grammys have also been criticized for being unfavorable and racist to black recording artists. Canadian artist [[Drake (musician)|Drake]] criticized the awards in a 2017 interview for seeing him only as a rapper and not as a pop-music artist because of his previous work and because of his heritage. He criticized the snubbing of \"[[One Dance]]\" for the prestigious award of Record of the Year and the nomination of \"[[Hotline Bling]]\" for [[Grammy Award for Best Rap Song|Best Rap Song]] and [[Grammy Award for Best Rap/Sung Performance|Best Rap/Sung Performance]] despite it not being a rap song, using it as evidence of The Recording Academy only seeing black artists as capable of producing rap music.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://nationofbillions.com/drake-meets-semtex-for-more-talk|title=Drake Meets Semtex For More Talk|newspaper=A Nation of Billions|access-date=February 19, 2017}}</ref> During the 2017 show, Adele pointedly broke the 'stunt trophy' for Album of the Year in half onstage and gave half to [[Beyoncé]], stating she felt that she didn't deserve to win over the latter's ''[[Lemonade (Beyoncé album)|Lemonade]]''.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.complex.com/music/2017/02/adele-grammy-award-broken-beyonce|title=The Real Story Behind Adele Breaking Her Grammy for Beyoncé|last=(no last name)|first=Khal|date=13 February 2017|work=[[Complex (magazine)|Complex]]|accessdate=1 February 2018}}</ref> ''[[The Atlantic]]''{{'}}s Spencer Kornhaber accused the Grammys of \"sidelining a black visionary work in favor of a white traditionalist one\".<ref>{{Cite web|title=Adele, Beyoncé, and the Grammys' Fear of Progress |url=https://www.theatlantic.com/entertainment/archive/2017/02/adele-beyonce-grammys-album-of-the-year-progress-25-lemonade/516426/ |last=Kornhaber |first=Spencer |website = [[The Atlantic]] |date=February 13, 2017 |access-date=March 25, 2017}}</ref> Drake and Frank Ocean were vocal about boycotting the Grammy Awards, Drake had a performance in Manchester, England on February 12, 2017, the same night as the Awards Ceremony.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.billboard.com/articles/news/grammys/7670151/drake-missing-grammys-justin-bieber-kanye-west|title=Drake Won't Be at the Grammy Awards|work=Billboard|access-date=2017-07-24}}</ref>\n\nThe Grammys have also received criticism for their treatment of female artists. Notably at the 60th Grammy Awards, New Zealand electropop singer-songwriter [[Lorde]] make media headlines after turning down an offer to perform at the ceremony. She claimed that she was invited to perform alongside several other artists in a tribute to [[Tom Petty]] but was refused a solo slot, despite being nominated for the [[Grammy Award for Album of the Year|Album of the Year]] Award and stated that each of the male nominees were allowed solo performances. Lorde's mother also criticised the Grammys, pointing out an article which stated that only nine percent of nominees at the previous six Grammy Awards were women<ref>http://www.nme.com/news/music/heres-lorde-turned-grammy-performance-2230515</ref>. Following the 60th ceremony, many media outlets reported that the ceremony had failed women, specifically pointing to the fact that the most nominated female artist [[SZA (singer)|SZA]] did not win in any of her five nominated categories and the [[Best Pop Solo Performance]] category which was composed of four female nominees yet was won by [[Ed Sheeran]] <ref>http://www.thefader.com/2018/01/29/grammys-essay-women-artists-2018</ref>. In an interview, [[Neil Portnow]], President of the Recording Academy attracted controversy by stating that female artists need to \"step up\" in order to win awards. Portnow's comments drew criticism from many female musicians including [[Pink (singer)|Pink]], [[Katy Perry]], [[Vanessa Carlton]], [[Sheryl Crow]], [[Iggy Azalea]], [[Halsey (singer)|Halsey]] and [[Charli XCX]]<ref>https://www.theguardian.com/music/2018/jan/30/pink-sheryl-crow-slam-grammys-neil-portnow-women-step-up</ref>.\n\n==TV broadcasts and ratings==\nPrior to the first live Grammys telecast in 1971 on [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]], a series of filmed annual specials in the 1960s called ''The Best on Record'' were broadcast on [[NBC]]. The first Grammy Award telecast took place on the night of November 29, 1959, as an episode of the NBC anthology series ''[[NBC Sunday Showcase]]'', which was normally devoted to plays, original TV dramas, and variety shows. Until 1971, awards ceremonies were held in both New York and Los Angeles, with winners accepting at one of the two. [[Pierre Cossette]] bought the rights to broadcast the ceremony from the National Academy of Recording Arts and Sciences and organized the first live telecast.<ref>{{cite book|first=Ken |last=Ehrlich |title=At The Grammys: Behind the Scenes at Music's Biggest Night |publisher=Hal Leonard Books |year=2007 |isbn=978-1-4234-3073-5}}</ref> [[CBS]] bought the rights in 1973 after moving the ceremony to [[Nashville]], [[Tennessee]]; the [[American Music Award]]s were created for ABC (by [[Dick Clark]]) as a result.\n\nThe Recording Academy announced on June 21, 2011 that it had reached a new deal with CBS to keep the awards show on the network for another 10 years.

Fifteen statuettes were awarded, honoring artists, directors and other participants in the film-making industry of the time, for their works during the 1927–28 period. The ceremony ran for 15&nbsp;minutes.\n\nWinners were announced to media three months earlier. That was changed for the second ceremony in 1930. Since then, for the rest of the first decade, the results were given to newspapers for publication at 11:00&nbsp;pm on the night of the awards.<ref name=\"history\" /> This method was used until an occasion when the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' announced the winners before the ceremony began; as a result, the Academy has, since 1941, used a sealed envelope to reveal the name of the winners.<ref name=\"history\" />\n\n===Institutions===\nThe first Best Actor awarded was [[Emil Jannings]], for his performances in ''[[The Last Command (1928 film)|The Last Command]]'' and ''[[The Way of All Flesh (1927 film)|The Way of All Flesh]]''. He had to return to Europe before the ceremony, so the Academy agreed to give him the prize earlier; this made him the first Academy Award winner in history. At that time, the winners were recognized for all of their work done in a certain category during the qualifying period; for example, Jannings received the award for two movies in which he starred during that period, and [[Janet Gaynor]] later won a single Oscar for performances in three films. With the fourth ceremony, however, the system changed, and professionals were honored for a specific performance in a single film. For the first six ceremonies, the eligibility period spanned two calendar years.<ref name=\"history\" />\n\nAt the 29th ceremony, held on March 27, 1957, the [[Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film|Best Foreign Language Film]] category was introduced. Until then, foreign-language films had been honored with the Special Achievement Award.\n\nThe 74th Academy Awards, held in 2002, presented the first [[Academy Award for Best Animated Feature]].\n\nSince 1973, all Academy Awards ceremonies have ended with the [[Academy Award for Best Picture]].\n\nTraditionally, the actors present the awards for actresses, and the actresses present the awards for actors.\n\n==Oscar statuette==\n\n===Other awards presented by the Academy===\n:''See also {{section link| |Special categories}} (below).''\nIn addition to the Academy Award of Merit (Oscar award), there are nine honorary (non-competitive) awards presented by the Academy from time to time (except for the Academy Honorary Award, the Technical Achievement Award, and the Student Academy Awards, which are presented annually):\n* [[Governors Awards]]:\n** The [[Academy Honorary Award]] (annual) (which may or may not be in the form of an Oscar statuette); <!-- See [[Governors Awards#Description and history]]). -->\n** The [[Irving G.

It is the culmination of the film awards season, which usually begins during November or December of the previous year. This is an elaborate extravaganza, with the invited guests walking up the red carpet in the creations of the most prominent fashion designers of the day. [[Black tie]] dress is the most common outfit for men, although fashion may dictate not wearing a [[bow-tie]], and musical performers sometimes do not adhere to this. (The artists who recorded the nominees for Best Original Song quite often perform those songs live at the awards ceremony, and the fact that they are performing is often used to promote the television broadcast.)\n\nThe Academy Awards is the only awards show televised live in all United States time zones (excluding Hawaii; they aired live in [[Alaska]] starting in 2011 for the first time since 1996), Canada, the United Kingdom, and gathers millions of viewers elsewhere throughout the world. The Oscars were first televised in 1953 by [[NBC]], which continued to broadcast the event until 1960, when [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] took over, televising the festivities (including the first color broadcast of the event in 1966) through 1970, after which NBC resumed the broadcasts. ABC once again took over broadcast duties in 1976, and has broadcast the Oscars ever since; its current contract with the Academy runs through 2028.<ref>{{cite news|url =http://www.oscars.org/news/abc-signs-expansive-new-agreement-broadcast-oscarsr-hollywoods-biggest-entertainment-ceremony|title=ABC SIGNS EXPANSIVE NEW AGREEMENT TO BROADCAST THE OSCARS®, HOLLYWOOD'S BIGGEST ENTERTAINMENT CEREMONY, THROUGH 2028|publisher=Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences\n|date= 31 August 2016|accessdate = 17 February 2017|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170202130914/https://www.oscars.org/news/abc-signs-expansive-new-agreement-broadcast-oscarsr-hollywoods-biggest-entertainment-ceremony|archivedate = 2 February 2017}}</ref> The Academy has also produced condensed versions of the ceremony for broadcast in international markets (especially those outside of the Americas) in more desirable local timeslots. The ceremony was broadcast live internationally for the first time via satellite in 1970, but only two South American countries, Chile and Brazil, purchased the rights to air the broadcast. By that time, the television rights to the Academy Awards had been sold in 50 countries. A decade later, the rights were already being sold to 60 countries, and by 1984, the TV rights to the Awards were licensed in 76 countries.\n\nThe ceremonies were moved up from late March or early April to late February or early March starting in 2004 to help disrupt and shorten the intense [[For Your Consideration (advertising)|lobbying and ad campaigns]] associated with [[Oscar season]] in the film industry. Another reason was because of the growing TV ratings success of the [[NCAA Division I Men's Basketball Tournament]], which would cut into the Academy Awards audience. The earlier date is also to the advantage of ABC, as it now usually occurs during the highly profitable and important February [[sweeps]] period. Some years, the ceremony is moved into early March in deference to the [[Winter Olympic Games|Winter Olympics]]. Another reason for the move to late February and early March is to avoid the awards ceremony occurring so close to the religious holidays of [[Passover]] and [[Easter]], which for decades had been a grievance from members and the general public. Advertising is somewhat restricted, however, as traditionally no movie studios or competitors of official Academy Award sponsors may advertise during the telecast. The Awards show holds the distinction of having won the most [[Emmy Awards|Emmys]] in history, with 47 wins and 195 nominations.<ref>{{cite news|url = http://goldderby.latimes.com/awards_goldderby/2010/07/emmys-love-for-oscars-continues-with-12-nominations.html|title = Emmys love for Oscars continues with 12 nominations\n|work=Los Angeles Times |author=Tom O'Neil|date= 12 July 2010|accessdate = 13 August 2010| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20100819172053/http://goldderby.latimes.com/awards_goldderby/2010/07/emmys-love-for-oscars-continues-with-12-nominations.html| archivedate= 19 August 2010 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref>\n\nAfter many years of being held on Mondays at 9:00&nbsp;pm [[Eastern Time Zone|Eastern]]/6:00 p.m [[Pacific Time Zone|Pacific]], in 1999 the ceremonies were moved to Sundays at 8:30&nbsp;pm Eastern/5:30&nbsp;pm Pacific.<ref>{{cite news|url = https://www.nytimes.com/1998/04/08/movies/tv-notes-moving-oscar-night.html|title = TV Notes; Moving Oscar Night|work=The New York Times |author=Bill Carter|date= 8 April 1998|accessdate = 8 March 2010|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140304185231/http://www.nytimes.com/1998/04/08/movies/tv-notes-moving-oscar-night.html|archivedate=2014-03-04}}</ref> The reasons given for the move were that more viewers would tune in on Sundays, that Los Angeles rush-hour traffic jams could be avoided, and an earlier start time would allow viewers on the East Coast to go to bed earlier.<ref>[https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1955&dat=19980701&id=-CsiAAAAIBAJ&sjid=eqYFAAAAIBAJ&pg=6637,43314 Academy Awards will move to Sunday night] Reading Eagle – 1 July 1998; From ''Google News Archive''</ref> For many years the film industry opposed a Sunday broadcast because it would cut into the weekend box office.<ref>[https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1980&dat=19990319&id=sKEiAAAAIBAJ&sjid=laoFAAAAIBAJ&pg=1224,4570799 Never Say Never: Academy Awards move to Sunday] The Item – 19 March 1999.

The Oscars have been infamously known for selecting specific genres of movies to be awarded. This has led to the coining of the term '[[Oscar bait]]', describing such movies. This has led at times to more specific criticisms that the Academy is disconnected from the audience, e.g., by favoring 'Oscar bait' over audience favorites, or favoring historical melodramas over critically acclaimed movies that depict current life issues.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.nypost.com/p/entertainment/movies/have_the_oscars_jumped_the_shark_LLhBrvPY35EnSH0iQzrqRJ |title=Have the Oscars jumped the shark? |accessdate=24 January 2012 | work=New York Post |first=Kyle |last=Smith|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120418115808/http://www.nypost.com/p/entertainment/movies/have_the_oscars_jumped_the_shark_LLhBrvPY35EnSH0iQzrqRJ |archivedate=2012-04-18}}</ref>\n\n===Allegations of a lack of diversity===\nThe Academy Awards have long received criticism over its lack of diversity among the nominees.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/movies/la-et-mn-hollywood-diversity-disabled-20160610-snap-story.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2017-04-25 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170426062804/http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/movies/la-et-mn-hollywood-diversity-disabled-20160610-snap-story.html |archivedate=26 April 2017 }}</ref><ref>diversityhttps://www.theguardian.com/society/2017/feb/24/oscars-diversity-debate-must-include-learning-disability</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://abcnews.go.com/Entertainment/oscars-2016-lack-diversity-historically-problem/story?id=37062502 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2017-04-25 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170426150745/http://abcnews.go.com/Entertainment/oscars-2016-lack-diversity-historically-problem/story?id=37062502 |archivedate=26 April 2017 }}</ref> The [[88th Academy Awards|88th awards ceremony]] became the target of a boycott, based on critics' perception that its all-white acting nominee list reflected bias.

The clause of the Pact of Umar which prohibited non-Muslims from building new places of worship was historically imposed on some communities of the Ottoman Empire and ignored in other cases, at the discretion of local authorities.

From 1839 to the declaration of a constitution in 1876, the Ottoman government instituted the [[Tanzimat]], a series of reforms designed to improve the status of minorities. Nevertheless, most of the reforms were never implemented because the empire's Muslim population rejected the principle of equality for Christians. By the late 1870s, the [[Greeks]], along with several other Christian nations in the [[Balkans]], frustrated with their conditions, had, often with the help of the [[Entente powers]], broken free of Ottoman rule. The Armenians remained, by and large, passive during these years, earning them the title of ''millet-i sadika'' or the \"loyal millet\".<ref name=\"Dadrian\">{{cite book |authorlink=Vahakn Dadrian |last=Dadrian |first=Vahakn N |title=The History of the Armenian Genocide: Ethnic Conflict from the Balkans to Anatolia to the Caucasus |place=Oxford |publisher=Berghahn Books |year=1995 | isbn=1-57181-666-6}}</ref>{{rp|192}}<ref>{{cite book|last1=Suny|first1=Ronald Grigor|title=Looking toward Ararat Armenia in modern history|date=1993|publisher=Indiana university press|location=Bloomington|isbn=0253207738|page=101|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=fsEeXBmL1vcC}}</ref>\n\nIn the mid-1860s and early 1870s this passivity gave way to new currents of thinking in Armenian society. Led by intellectuals educated at European universities or American missionary schools in Turkey, Armenians began to question their second-class status and press for better treatment from their government. In one such instance, after amassing the signatures of peasants from Western Armenia, the Armenian Communal Council petitioned the Ottoman government to redress their principal grievances: \"the looting and murder in Armenian towns by [Muslim] [[Kurds]] and [[Circassians]], improprieties during tax collection, criminal behavior by government officials and the refusal to accept Christians as witnesses in trial\". The Ottoman government considered these grievances and promised to punish those responsible, but no meaningful steps to do so were ever taken.<ref name=\"Akçam\" />{{rp |36}}\n\nFollowing the violent suppression of Christians during the [[Great Eastern Crisis]], particularly in [[Herzegovina uprising (1875–77)|Bosnia and Herzegovina]], [[April Uprising|Bulgaria]] and [[Serbian–Ottoman War (1876–1878)|Serbia]], the [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|United Kingdom]] and [[France]] invoked the 1856 [[Treaty of Paris (1856)|Treaty of Paris]] by claiming that it gave them the right to intervene and protect the Ottoman Empire's Christian minorities.<ref name=\"Akçam\" />{{rp |35ff}} Under growing pressure, the government of [[Ottoman Sultan|Sultan]] [[Abdul Hamid II]] declared itself a constitutional monarchy with a parliament (which was almost immediately [[Legislative session#Common procedure|prorogued]]) and entered into negotiations with the powers. At the same time, the Armenian patriarch of Constantinople, Nerses II, forwarded Armenian complaints of widespread \"forced land seizure&nbsp;... forced conversion of women and children, arson, [[Protection racket|protection extortion]], rape, and murder\" to the Powers.<ref name=\"Akçam\" />{{rp |37}}\n\nThe Russo-Turkish War of 1877–78 ended with Russia's decisive victory and its army in occupation of large parts of eastern Turkey, but not before entire Armenian districts had been devastated by massacres carried out with the connivance of Ottoman authorities. In the wake of these events, Patriarch Nerses and his emissaries made repeated approaches to Russian leaders to urge the inclusion of a clause granting local self-government to the Armenians in the forthcoming [[Treaty of San Stefano]], which was signed on 3 March 1878. The Russians were receptive and drew up the clause, but the Ottomans flatly rejected it during negotiations. In its place, the two sides agreed on a clause making the [[Sublime Porte]]'s implementation of reforms in the Armenian provinces a condition of Russia's withdrawal, thus designating Russia the guarantor of the reforms.<ref>{{citation |title=[[Treaty of San Stefano]] |quote=As the evacuation of the Russian troops of the territory they occupy in Armenia&nbsp;... might give rise to conflicts and complications detrimental to the maintenance of good relations between the two countries, the [[Sublime Porte]] engaged to carry into effect, without further delay, the improvements and reforms demanded by local requirements in the provinces inhabited by Armenians and to guarantee their security from Kurds and [[Circassians]]. |chapter=Article 16}}</ref> The clause entered the treaty as Article 16 and marked the first appearance of what came to be known in European diplomacy as the ''[[Armenian Question]]''.\n\nOn receiving a copy of the treaty, Britain promptly objected to it and particularly Article 16, which it saw as ceding too much influence to Russia. It immediately pushed for a congress of the [[great powers]] to be convened to discuss and revise the treaty, leading to the [[Congress of Berlin]] in June–July 1878. {{#tag:ref|The great powers at the Congress of Berlin were Russia, Great Britain, France, Austria-Hungary, Italy and Germany<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=EhqpAgAAQBAJ&pg=PA12#v=onepage&q&f=false|title=Iran-Turkey Relations, 1979-2011: Conceptualising the Dynamics of Politics, Religion and Security in Middle-Power States|last=Elik|first=Suleyman|date=2013|page=12|publisher=Routledge|isbn=9781136630880|language=en}}</ref>|group=\"note\"}} Patriarch Nerses sent a delegation led by his distinguished predecessor, Archbishop [[Khrimian Hayrik]], to speak for the Armenians, but it was not admitted into the sessions on the grounds that it did not represent a country. Confined to the periphery, the delegation did its best to contact the representatives of the powers and argue the case for Armenian administrative autonomy within the Ottoman Empire, but to little effect.\n\nFollowing an understanding reached with Ottoman representatives, Britain drew up an emasculated version of Article 16 to replace the original, a clause that retained the call for reforms, but omitted any reference to the Russian occupation, thereby dispensing with the principal guarantee of their implementation. Despite an ambiguous reference to Great Power supervision, the clause failed to offset the removal of the Russian guarantee with any tangible equivalent, thus leaving the timing and fate of the reforms to the discretion of the [[Sublime Porte]].<ref name=\"Akçam\" />{{rp|38–39}} The clause was readily adopted as Article 61 of the [[Treaty of Berlin (1878)|Treaty of Berlin]] on the last day of the Congress, 13 July 1878, to the deep disappointment of the Armenian delegation.\n\n=== Armenian national liberation movement ===\n{{Main|Armenian national liberation movement}}\nProspects for reforms faded rapidly following the signing of the Berlin treaty, as security conditions in the Armenian provinces went from bad to worse and abuses proliferated.

Many in the empire saw their defeat as \"Allah's divine punishment for a society that did not know how to pull itself together\".<ref name = \"Akçam\" />{{rp |84}} The Turkish nationalist movement in the country gradually came to view [[Anatolia]] as their last refuge. The Armenian population formed a significant minority in this region.\n\nAn important consequence of the [[Balkan Wars]] was also the mass expulsion of Muslims (known as ''[[muhacir]]s'') from the Balkans. Beginning in the mid-19th century, hundreds of thousands of Muslims, including [[Turkish people|Turks]], [[Circassians]], and [[Chechens]], were forcibly expelled and others voluntarily migrated from the [[Caucasus]] and the Balkans ([[Rumelia]]) as a result of the Russo-Turkish wars, the [[Circassian genocide]] and the conflicts in the Balkans. Muslim society in the empire was incensed by this flood of refugees. A journal published in Constantinople expressed the mood of the times: \"Let this be a warning&nbsp;... O Muslims, don't get comfortable! Do not let your blood cool before taking revenge\".<ref name = \"Akçam\" />{{rp |86}} As many as 850,000 of these refugees were settled in areas where the Armenians resided. The ''muhacirs'' resented the status of their relatively well-off neighbors and, as historian [[Taner Akçam]] and others have noted, some of them came to play a pivotal role in the killings of the Armenians and the [[Confiscated Armenian properties in Turkey|confiscation of their properties]] during the genocide.<ref name = \"Akçam\" />{{rp |86–87}}\n\n== World War I ==\n{{See also|Middle Eastern theatre of World War I}}\nOn 2 November 1914, the Ottoman Empire opened the Middle Eastern theater of World War I by entering hostilities on the side of the [[Central Powers]] and against the [[Allies of World War I|Allies]].

Before entering the war, the [[Imperial Government (Ottoman Empire)|Ottoman government]] had sent representatives to the [[Armenian congress at Erzurum]] to persuade Ottoman Armenians to facilitate its conquest of [[Transcaucasia]] by inciting an insurrection of Russian Armenians against the Russian army in the event a [[Caucasus Campaign|Caucasus front]] was opened.<ref name = \"Akçam\" />{{rp |136}}<ref>{{Cite book | last1 = Walker | first1 = Christopher J | authorlink = Christopher J.

Germany had brokered a deal with the [[Sublime Porte]] to commission the building of a railroad called the [[Baghdad Railway]] that would stretch from Berlin to the Middle East. At the beginning of 1915, Germany's diplomatic mission was led by Ambassador [[Hans Freiherr von Wangenheim]] who, upon his death in 1915, was succeeded by Count [[Paul Wolff Metternich]]. Like Morgenthau, von Wangenheim began receiving many disturbing messages from consular officials around the Ottoman Empire that detailed the massacres of Armenians. From the province of [[Adana]], Consul Eugene Buge reported that the CUP chief had sworn to massacre any Armenians who had survived the deportation marches.<ref name=\"Balakian\" />{{rp |186}} In June 1915, von Wangenheim sent a cable to Berlin reporting that Talaat had admitted that the deportations were not \"being carried out because of 'military considerations alone'\". One month later, he came to the conclusion that there \"no longer was doubt that the Porte was trying to exterminate the Armenian race in the Turkish Empire\".<ref name=\"Fromkin\" />{{rp |213}}\n\nWhen Wolff-Metternich succeeded von Wangenheim, he continued to dispatch similar cables: \"The Committee [CUP] demands the extirpation of the last remnants of the Armenians and the government must yield&nbsp;...

He sent fifteen reports regarding \"deportations and mass killings\" to the German chancellery.

This was to give justification for the deportation of Armenians, which is still argued by genocide deniers to this day.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Ambrosio|first1=Thomas|title=Ethnic identity groups and U.S. foreign policy|date=2002|publisher=Praeger|location=Westport (Conn.)|isbn=0275975320|pages=155–6|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0bsHGrl9p4sC}}</ref> Richter stated the deportations were intentionally meant to cover up the slaughter of Armenians:\n\n<blockquote>I have conducted a series of conversations with competent and influential Turkish personages, and these are my impressions: A large segment of the Ittihadist [Young Turk] party maintains the viewpoint that the Turkish empire should be based only on the principle of Islam and Pan-Turkism. Its non-Muslim and non-Turkish inhabitants should either be forcibly islamized, or otherwise they ought to be destroyed. These gentlemen believe that the time is propitious for the realization of this plan. The first item on this agenda concerns the liquidation of the Armenians. Ittihad will dangle before the Allies a specter of an alleged revolution prepared by the Armenian Dashnak party. Moreover, local incidents of social unrest and acts of Armenian self-defense will deliberately be provoked and inflated and will be used as pretexts to effect the deportations. Once en route, however, the convoys will be attacked and exterminated by Kurdish and Turkish brigands, and in part by gendarmes, who will be instigated for that purpose by Ittihad.<ref>{{cite book|last=Charney|first=Israel|title=The Widening Circle of Genocide|publisher=W.

I also know that both Armenians and Turks cannot live together in this country. One of these races has got to go. And I don't blame the Turks for what they are doing to the Armenians.

Whenever possible complete restitution or restoration to the previous condition should be granted. Where it is not possible, relevant compensation may be substituted as a remedy.

The revolution led to the establishment of a [[Parliament]] and approval of the first constitution. Although the constitutional revolution was successful in weakening the autocracy of the [[Qajar dynasty|Qajar]] regime, it failed to provide a powerful alternative government. Consequently, within the decades following the establishment of the new parliament, a number of critical events took place. Many of these events can be viewed as a continuation of the struggle between the constitutionalists and the Shahs of Persia, many of whom were backed by foreign powers against the parliament.\n\n=== Reza Shah ===\n       {{Main article|Rezā Shāh}}\nInsecurity and chaos created after the Constitutional Revolution led to the rise of General Reza Khan, the commander of the elite Persian Cossack Brigade who seized power in a coup d'état in February 1921. He established a constitutional monarchy, deposing the last of the Qajar shah in 1925 and introduced many social, economic, and political reforms during his reign. A number of these reforms led to public discontent which provides circumstances for an Iranian revolution.\nMohammad Reza Shah Pahlavi's father, [[Reza Shah]], replaced [[fiqh|Islamic laws]] with Western ones, which forbade traditional Islamic clothing, [[Sex segregation and Islam|separation of the sexes]] and veiling of women's faces with the [[niqab]].<ref>[[#Mackey|Mackey]], p. 184</ref> Police forcibly removed and tore [[chador]]s off women who resisted his ban on the public hijab.

However, he would avoid entering into political issues, as did other religious leaders who followed him. Hence, no widespread anti-government attempts were organized by clergy during the Reza Shah Rule. However, the future Ayatollah [[Khomeini]] was a student of Sheikh Abdul Karim Ha’eri.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Rajaee|first1=Farhang|title=Islamism and Modernism: The Changing Discourse in Iran|date=2010|publisher=University of Texas Press|isbn=9780292774360}}</ref>\n\n=== Mosaddegh and The Anglo Iranian Oil Company (today BP) ===\n{{Main article|Mohammad Mosaddegh}}{{Main article|Anglo-Persian Oil Company}}\nFrom 1901 on, the Anglo-Persian Oil Company (renamed the Anglo-Iranian oil company in 1931) - a British oil company - enjoyed the monopoly on sale and production of Iranian oil. It was the most profitable British business in the world. Most Iranians lived in poverty while the wealth generated from Iranian oil played a decisive role in maintaining Britain at the top of the world. In 1951 Iranian Prime Minister Mohammad Mosaddegh pledged to throw the company out of Iran, reclaim the petroleum reserves and free Iran from foreign powers.\n\nMosaddegh nationalized the Anglo-Iranian oil company and became a national hero. The British, however, were outraged and accused him of stealing. The British demanded punishment by the World Court and the United Nations, sent warships to the Persian Gulf and finally imposed a crushing embargo.\n\nMosaddegh was unmoved by Britain's campaign against him. One European newspaper, the [[Frankfurter Neue Presse]], reported that Mosaddegh \"would rather be fried in Persian oil than make the slightest concession for the British\". The British considered an armed invasion, but U.S. President [[Harry S. Truman]] refused his support. U.K. Prime Minister [[Winston Churchill]] decided for a coup. Mosaddegh, however, learned of their plans and ordered the British embassy shuttered in October 1952. All British diplomats and agents had to leave the country.\n\nThe British asked Truman for help; Truman, however, sympathized with nationalist movements like Mosaddegh's and had nothing but contempt for old-style imperialists like those who ran Anglo-Iranian. However, [[Dwight D. Eisenhower]]'s election as U.S. President in November 1952 changed the U.S.'s stance toward the conflict. On 20 January 1953, U.S. Secretary of State [[John Foster Dulles]] and his brother, director of the C.I.A. [[Allen Dulles]], told their British counterparts that they were ready to move against Mosaddegh. In their eyes, any country not decisively allied with the United States was a potential enemy. Iran had immense oil wealth, a long border with the Soviet Union and a nationalist Prime Minister. A fall into communism and a \"second China\" terrified the Dulles brothers.

Mohammad Reza Shah's reform program was built especially to weaken those classes that supported the traditional system. It consisted of several  elements including: the land reform; sales of some state-owned factories to finance the land reform; the enfranchisement of women; nationalization of forests and pastures; formation of a literacy corps; and institution of profit sharing schemes for workers in industry.<ref>{{Cite book|author=Amir Arjomand, Said|title=The Turban for the Crown: The Islamic Revolution in Iran |location=|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=1988|pages=72–73|isbn=9780195042580}}</ref>\n\nThe Shah advertised the White Revolution as a step towards westernization<ref>{{cite news|title=Iran: The White Revolution|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,842491,00.html|work=Time Magazine|accessdate=10 March 2011|date=11 February 1966|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110201232009/http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,842491,00.html|archivedate=1 February 2011|df=dmy-all}}</ref> and was a way for him to legitimize the Pahlavi dynasty. Part of the reason for launching the White Revolution was that the Shah hoped to get rid of the landlords' influence and create a new base of support among the peasants and working class.<ref>{{Cite book|author=Siavoshi, Sussan|title=Liberal Nationalism in Iran: The failure of a movement|location=Boulder, Colorado|publisher=Westview Press|year=1990|page=23|isbn=978-0-8133-7413-0}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book|author=Bayar, Assef|chapter=Historiography, class, and Iranian workers|editor=Lockman, Zachary|year=1994|title=Workers and Working Classes in the Middle East: Struggles, Histories, Historiographies|publisher=State University of New York Press|location=Albany, New York|page=[https://books.google.com/books?id=BFzOVmj1iCIC&pg=PA198 198]|isbn=978-0-7914-1665-5}}</ref>\n\nThus the White Revolution in Iran represented a new attempt to introduce reform from above and preserve traditional power patterns. Through land reform, the essence of the White Revolution, the Shah hoped to ally himself with the peasantry in the countryside, and hoped to sever their ties with the aristocracy in the city. What the Shah did not expect was that the White Revolution led to new social tensions that helped create many of the problems the Shah had been trying to avoid. The Shah's reforms more than quadrupled the combined size of the two classes that had posed the most challenges to his monarchy in the past – the intelligentsia and the urban working class. Their resentment towards the Shah also grew since they were now stripped of organizations that had represented them in the past, such as political parties, professional associations, trade unions, and independent newspapers. The land reform, instead of allying the peasants with the government, produced large numbers of independent farmers and landless laborers who became loose political cannons, with no feeling of loyalty to the Shah. Many of the masses felt resentment towards the increasingly corrupt government; their loyalty to the clergy, who were seen as more concerned with the fate of the populace, remained consistent or increased. As Ervand Abrahamian pointed out, ''The White Revolution had been designed to preempt a Red Revolution. Instead, it paved the way for an Islamic Revolution.''<ref>{{harvnb|Abrahamian|2008|pages=139–40}}</ref> The White Revolution's economic \"[[Trickle-down economics|trickle-down]]\" strategy also did not work as intended. In theory, oil money funneled to the elite was supposed to be used to create jobs and factories, eventually distributing the money, but instead the wealth tended to get stuck at the top and concentrated in the hands of the very few.<ref>{{harvnb|Abrahamian|2008|page=140}}</ref>\n\n=== Rise of Ayatollah Khomeini ===\n[[File:عکسی از خمینی.JPG|thumbnail|Khomeini]]\n{{Main article|Ruhollah Khomeini}}\n{{See also|Movement of 15 Khordad}}\n{{multiple image\n<!-- Layout parameters -->\n | align             = <!-- right (default), left, center, none --> \n | direction         = vertical \n | background color  = <!-- box background -->\n | width             = <!-- displayed width of each image in pixels (an integer, omit \"px\" suffix); overrides \"width[n]\"s below -->\n | caption_align     = <!-- left (default), center, right --> \n\n<!-- Header -->\n | header_background = \n | header_align      = <!-- center (default), left, right -->\n | header            = \n\n<!--image 1-->\n | image1            = 15khordad1.jpg\n | width1            = 200\n | alt1              = \n | link1             = \n | thumbtime1        =\n | caption1          =  People of Tehran in the [[Movement of 15 Khordad|demonstrations of 5 June 1963]] with pictures of Ruhollah Khomeini in their hands.\n<!--image 2-->\n | image2            =Khordad222.jpg\n | width2            = 200\n | alt2              = \n | link2             = \n | thumbtime2        =\n | caption2          = Protesters carrying the body of one of the victims\n<!-- and so on, to a maximum of 10 images (image10) -->\n}}\nThe post-revolutionary leader – Shia cleric [[Ayatollah]] Ruhollah Khomeini – first came to political prominence in 1963 when he led opposition to the Shah and his [[White Revolution]].

Khomeini left Iraq, instead moving to a house bought by Iranian exiles in [[Neauphle-le-Château]], a village near [[Paris]], [[France]]. The Shah hoped that Khomeini would be cut off from the mosques of Najaf and be cut off from the protest movement. Instead, the plan backfired badly.

There the two signed an agreement for a draft constitution that would be \"Islamic and democratic\". It signaled the now official alliance between the clergy and the secular opposition.<ref name=\"Milani Shah\" /><ref name=\"Axworthy\" /> In order to help create a democratic facade, Khomeini placed Westernized figures (such as Sadegh Qotbzadeh and Ebrahim Yazdi) as the public spokesmen of the opposition, and never spoke to the media of his intentions to create a theocracy.<ref name=\"Milani Shah\" />\n\n==== Continued conflict ====\nStreet demonstrations continued at full force with little response from the military; by late October, government officials effectively even ceded the [[University of Tehran]] to student protesters.<ref name=\"Kraft-New Yorker\" /><ref name=\"Harney\">[[#Harney|Harney]]</ref> Worse, the opposition was increasingly becoming armed with weapons, firing at soldiers and attacking banks and government buildings in an attempt to destabilize the country.<ref name=\"Amuzegar\" /><ref name=\"Pahlavi 2004\" />\n\nOn 5 November, demonstrations at University of Tehran became deadly after a fight broke out with armed soldiers.<ref name=\"Abrahamian\" /><ref name=\"Kurzman\" /><ref name=\"Kraft-New Yorker\" /><ref name=\"Harney\" /> Within hours, Tehran broke out into a full-scale riot.

Secular and leftist politicians piled onto the movement hoping to gain power in the aftermath, ignoring the fact that Khomeini was the very antithesis to all of the positions they supported.<ref name=\"Milani Shah\" /> While it was increasingly clear to more secular Iranians that Khomeini was not a liberal, he was widely perceived as a figurehead, and that power would eventually be handed to the secular groups.<ref name=\"Milani Shah\" /><ref name=\"Harney\" />\n\n==== Demoralization of the Army ====\nThe military leadership was increasingly paralyzed by indecision, and rank-and-file soldiers were demoralized, having been forced to confront demonstrators while prohibited from using their own weapons (and being condemned by the Shah if they did).<ref name=\"Eisenstadt\" /> Increasingly, Khomeini called on the soldiers of the armed forces to defect to the opposition.<ref name=\"Pahlavi 2004\" /><ref name=\"Abrahamian 1982\" /> Revolutionaries gave flowers and civilian clothes to deserters, while threatening retribution to those who stayed.

The telegram effectively declared his belief that the Shah would not survive the protests, and that the US should consider withdrawing its support for his government and persuading the monarch to abdicate. The United States would then help assemble a coalition of pro-Western military officers, middle class professionals, and moderate clergy, with Khomeini installed as a Gandhi-like spiritual leader.<ref name=\"Little\">{{cite book|last=Little|first=Douglas|title=American Orientalism: The United States and the Middle East since 1945|url=https://books.google.com/?id=jb3ai8l6jWMC&pg=PA225&lpg=PA225&dq=William+Sullivan+thinking+the+unthinkable#v=onepage&q=William%20Sullivan%20thinking%20the%20unthinkable&f=false|isbn=9780807877616|date=15 September 2009}}</ref>\n\nThe telegram touched off a vigorous debate in the American cabinet, with some (such as National Security Advisor [[Zbigniew Brzezinski]]<ref name=\"Little\" />) rejecting it outright.

On 28 December, he secured an agreement with another major National Front figure, Shahpour Bakhtiar. Bakhtiar would be appointed prime minister (a return to civilian rule), while the Shah and his family would leave the country for a \"vacation\". His royal duties would be carried out by a Regency Council, and three months after his departure a referendum would be submitted to the people deciding on whether Iran would remain a monarchy or become a republic. A former opponent of the Shah, Bakhtiar became motivated to join the government because he was increasingly aware of Khomeini's intentions to implement hard-line religious rule rather than a democracy.<ref name=\"Milani-Persians\" /> Karim Sanjabi immediately expelled Bakhtiar from the National Front, and Bakhtiar was denounced by Khomeini (who declared that acceptance of his government was the equivalent of \"obedience to false gods\").<ref name=\"Milani Shah\" /><ref name=\"Geist\">{{cite web|last=Geist|first=Dan|title='A Darker Horizon': The Assassination of Shapour Bakhtiar|url=https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/tehranbureau/2011/08/a-darker-horizon-the-assassination-of-shapour-bakhtiar.html|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160609050914/http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/tehranbureau/2011/08/a-darker-horizon-the-assassination-of-shapour-bakhtiar.html|archivedate=9 June 2016|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\n==== The Shah leaves ====\nThe Shah, hoping to see Bakhtiar established, kept delaying his departure.

To demonstrate his support, Khomeini called for demonstrators to occupy the streets throughout the country. He also sent a letter to American officials warning them to withdraw support for Bakhtiar.<ref name=\"Milani Shah\" /> Bakhtiar became increasingly isolated, with members of the government (including the entire Regency Council) defecting to Khomeini.

Scholar Guity Nashat highlights this neglected aspect of the revolution, “Although women’s participation in the events leading to the February 11 revolution was instrumental in its success, most studies have not addressed the reasons for their involvement or their contribution.”<ref>{{cite book |title=Women and revolution in Iran |last=Nashat |first=Guity |date=1983 |publisher=Westview Press |year= |isbn=0-86531-931-6 |location= |pages=1}}</ref> Janet Baur argues the necessity of examine the daily lives of women, their living conditions and their relationship to other groups in order to understand their participation in the socio-political events of the revolution. She further explains that the cultural, ideological, social and material factors shaping the social life and class differences in the period just prior to the revolution need to be studied in order to understand how the Iranian women's social consciousness developed and how it led them to take part in public protests.<ref name=\":2\" /> Caroline M. Brooks argues that women were left to express their concerns through the protest rather than in the [[Majlis of Iran|Majlis]]. Thus, this created a \"dangerous bargaining position for activist women\" since rather than arguing and their position through intellect they were only able to \"argue by numbers in the streets and be repelled by force\".<ref name=\":3\" />\n\nThere are some contesting understandings in academic literature regarding the reasons behind the mobilization of women. While some argue that the micro level actions of women can be understood through religious and political ideologies, others argue that that it is in fact the effect of manipulations of information, symbols and context which should be studied.<ref name=\":2\" />\n\n=== Casualties ===\n{{Further information|Casualties of the Iranian Revolution}}\nSome sources (such as [[Emadeddin Baghi]], a researcher at the [[Bonyad#Islamic Republic|Martyrs Foundation]]) claim 2,781 protesters and revolutionaries were killed in 1978–79 during the Revolution.<ref name=\"Baghi\"/><ref>Researcher Emad al-Din Baghi at the Martyrs Foundation (Bonyad Shahid) counted 2,781 protesters killed in 1978–79, a total of 3,164 killed between 1963 and 1979.</ref> Khomeini reported of a much larger number; he said that \"60,000 men, women and children were martyred by the Shah's regime.\"<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/><ref name=\"emadbaghi2\">[http://www.emadbaghi.com/en/archives/000592.php#more A Question of Numbers] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140804172903/http://www.emadbaghi.com/en/archives/000592.php |date=4 August 2014 }} IranianVoice.org 8 August 2003 Rouzegar-Now Cyrus Kadivar</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.iranchamber.com/government/laws/constitution.php|title=Iran Chamber Society: The Constitution of Islamic Republic of Iran|work=iranchamber.com|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100218140202/http://www.iranchamber.com/government/laws/constitution.php|archivedate=18 February 2010|df=dmy-all}}</ref>  According to at least one western source (historian [[Ervand Abrahamian]]), the number executed by revolutionary courts as the revolution was consolidated (8000 opponents between June 1981 and June 1985<ref>[[Mojahedin-e Khalq]], but also \"Fedayins and Kurds as well as Tudeh, National Front, and Shariatmadari supporters\"</ref>) exceeded those killed by the royalist government trying to stop the revolution.<ref>Abrahamian, Ervand (2008) ''History of Modern Iran'', Columbia University Press, p. 181</ref>\nWhile Iranians believed the opposition's casualty figures, post-revolution western and thus anti-revolution estimates mostly supported the defeated government's casualty figures.<ref name=\"Baghi\"/><ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/><ref name=\"Afkhami\"/><ref name=\"Kurzman\"/><ref name=Amuzegar>{{cite book|last=Amuzegar|first=Jahangir|title=Dynamics of the Iranian Revolution|url=https://books.google.com/?id=3KL5FvOejKkC&pg=PA253|page=253|isbn=9780791407318|year=1991}}</ref>\n\n=== Songs of Iranian Revolution ===\nIranian revolutionary songs are ballads epic that composed  during the Islamic Revolution in Iran in support of the revolution and opposition the Pahlavi dynasty.<ref name=\"Torab2007\">{{cite book|author=Azam Torab|title=Performing Islam: Gender and Ritual in Islam|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=XsWorLT4p3UC|year=2007|publisher=BRILL|pages=142–43|isbn=90-04-15295-4|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160805073753/https://books.google.com/books?id=XsWorLT4p3UC|archivedate=5 August 2016|df=dmy-all}}</ref> Before the victory of revolution, these chants were made by various political supporters and many of them recorded on cassette tapes in underground and home studios.

In late October 1979, the exiled and dying Shah was admitted into the United States for cancer treatment. In Iran there was an immediate outcry and both Khomeini and leftist groups demanding the Shah's return to Iran for trial and execution. On 4 November 1979 youthful Islamists, calling themselves [[Muslim Student Followers of the Imam's Line]], invaded the embassy compound and [[Iran hostage crisis|seized its staff]]. Revolutionaries were angry because of how the Shah had fled abroad while the Embassy-based American CIA and British intelligence organized a [[1953 Iranian coup d'état|coup d'état]] to overthrow his nationalist opponent who was a legitimately elected official.\n\nThe holding of hostages was very popular and continued for months even after the death of the Shah. As Khomeini explained to his future President [[Abolhassan Banisadr|Banisadr]],{{quote|This action has many benefits. ... This has united our people. Our opponents do not dare act against us. We can put the constitution to the people's vote without difficulty ...<ref>[[#Moin|Moin]], p. 228</ref>}}\n\nWith great publicity [[Muslim Student Followers of the Imam's Line|the students]] released documents from the American embassy or \"nest of spies,\" showing moderate Iranian leaders had met with U.S. officials (similar evidence of high-ranking Islamists having done so did not see the light of day).<ref>[[#Moin|Moin]], pp. 248–49</ref> Among the casualties of the hostage crisis was Prime Minister Bazargan and his government who resigned in November unable to enforce the government's order to release the hostages.<ref>[[#Keddie|Keddie]], p. 249</ref>\n\nThe prestige of Khomeini and the hostage taking was further enhanced with the failure of a hostage rescue attempt, widely credited to divine intervention.<ref>Bowden, Mark, ''Guests of the Ayatollah'', Atlantic Monthly Press, 2006, p. 487</ref>\n\nIt ended with the signing of the [[Algiers Accords]] in Algeria on 19 January 1981. The hostages were formally released into United States custody the following day, just minutes after the new American president [[Ronald Reagan]] was sworn in. The hostages had been held at the U.S. embassy in Tehran for 444 days.\n\n==== Suppression of opposition ====\n{{see also|Nojeh coup plot}}\nIn early March Khomeini announced, \"do not use this term, ‘democratic.’ That is the Western style,\" giving pro-democracy liberals (and later leftists) a taste of disappointments to come.<ref>[[#Bakhash|Bakhash]], p. 73.</ref>\n\nIn succession the [[National Democratic Front (Iran)|National Democratic Front]] was banned in August 1979, the provisional government was disempowered in November, the [[Muslim People's Republican Party]] banned in January 1980, the [[People's Mujahedin of Iran]] guerrillas came under attack in February 1980, a purge of universities was begun in March 1980, and leftist Islamist [[Abolhassan Banisadr]] was impeached in June 1981.{{citation needed|date=February 2017}}\n\nAfter the revolution, human rights groups estimated the number of casualties suffered by protesters and prisoners of the new system to be several thousand.

Brief trials lacking defense attorneys, juries, transparency or opportunity for the accused to defend themselves,<ref>[[#Bakhash|Bakhash]], p. 61.</ref> were held by revolutionary judges such as [[Sadegh Khalkhali]], the ''[[Sharia]]'' judge.

Khomeini attacked the MEK as ''[[Munafiq|monafeqin]] ''(hypocrites) and ''[[kafir|kafer]]'' (unbelievers).<ref>[[#Moin|Moin]], pp. 234, 239</ref>  ''Hezbollahi'' people attacked meeting places, bookstores, newsstands of Mujahideen and other leftists<ref>[[#Bakhash|Bakhash]], p. 123.</ref> driving them underground.

An attempt by Khomeini to forge a reconciliation between Banisadr and IRP leaders had failed<ref>[[#Bakhash|Bakhash]], p. 153</ref> and now it was Banisadr who was the rallying point \"for all doubters and dissidents\" of the theocracy, including the MEK.<ref>[[#Moin|Moin]], p. 238</ref>\n\nWhen leaders of the [[National Front (Iran)|National Front]] called for a demonstration in June 1981 in favor of Banisadr, Khomeini threatened its leaders with the death penalty for apostasy \"if they did not repent.\"<ref>[[#Schirazi|Schirazi]], p. 127.</ref>  Leaders of the [[Freedom Movement of Iran]] were compelled to make and publicly broadcast apologies for supporting the Front's appeal.<ref>[[#Schirazi|Schirazi]], p. 127</ref> Those attending the rally were menaced by Hezbollahi and Revolutionary Guards and intimidated into silence.<ref>[[#Bakhash|Bakhash]], pp. 158–59</ref>\n\nThe MEK retaliated with a campaign of terror against the IRP. On 28 June 1981, a bombing of the office of the IRP killed around 70 high-ranking officials, cabinet members and members of parliament, including [[Mohammad Beheshti]], the secretary-general of the party and head of the Islamic Republic's judicial system. The government responded with thousands of arrests and hundreds of executions.<ref>[[#Moin|Moin]], pp. 241–42.</ref> Despite these and other assassinations<ref name=autogenerated3 /> the hoped-for mass uprising and armed struggle against the Khomeiniists was crushed.\n\nThe MEK bombings were not the only violent opposition to the Khomeinist rule.

It was with one of these countries that the [[Iran–Iraq War]], which killed hundreds of thousands and dominated life in the Islamic Republic for the next eight years, was fought.

The attempt was a reaction to the secular political discourse namely Marxism, liberalism and nationalism. However we could observe the great influence of western culture in Iran after coup d’etat in 1953. Following the death of Ayatollah Boroujerdi, some of the scholars like Murtaza Mutahhari, Muhammad Beheshti and Muhmud Talighani found new opportunity to change conditions. Before them, Boroujerdi was considered as a conservative Marja. They tried to reform conditions after the death of the ayatollah. They presented their arguments by rendering lectures in 1960 and 1963 in Tehran. The result of the lectures was the book \"An inquiry into principles of Mar’jaiyat\". Some of the major issues highlighted were the government in Islam, the need for the clergy's independent financial organization, Islam as a way of life, advising and guiding youth and necessity of being community. Allameh Tabatabei refers to velayat as a political philosophy for Shia and velayat faqih for Shia community. There are also other attempts to formulate a new attitude of Islam such as the publication of three volumes of Maktab Tashayyo.  Also somebodies believe that it is indispensable to revive the religious gathered in Hoseyniyeh-e-Ershad.<ref>{{cite book|authors=Samih Farsoun, MehrdadMashayekhi|url=https://books.google.com/books/about/Iran.html?id=S1RsZrwm2p4C|title=Iran: Political Culture in the Islamic Republic|isbn=9780203993514|date=7 January 1993}}</ref>\n\n== Gallery ==\n<gallery>\nFile:زخمی انقلابی.JPG|An injured revolutionary during protests against Pahlavi regime.\nFile:اعتراض مردم انقلابی.JPG|Protests in summer 1978.\nFile:شهیدان انقلابی.JPG|Revolutionary victims.\nFile:هفده شهریور.JPG|Black Friday.\nFile:Iranian Revolution Women.jpg|Women protesting during Iranian Revolution in 1979.\nFile:Ali Khamenei in Iranian Revolution protests.jpg|Current Iranian leader, [[Ali Khamenei]] in a Revolutionary protest in [[Mashhad]].\nFile:Shapour Bakhtiar Cabinet.jpg|Shah visiting Bakhtiar cabinet before his exit from Iran.\nFile:1978 Iranian revolution - row of men holding khomeini's photos.jpg|Row of men holding Khomeini's photos.\nFile:Shah's exit from Iran 04.jpg|People celebrating Shah's exit from the country.\nFile:Statue of Shah Revolution.jpg|Removal of Shah's statue by the people in [[University of Tehran]].\nFile:خمینی در مهرآباد.JPG|Khomeini at [[Mehrabad Airport]].\nFile:خمینی میان مردم.JPG|People accompanying Khomeini from Mehrabad to [[Behesht Zahra]].\nFile:خمینی در بهشت زهرا.JPG|Khomeini in Behesht Zahra.\n|People protesting beside [[Shahyad Tower]] (now [[Azadi Tower]]).\nFile:ExecutionGenerals150279.jpg|Executed Generals of Imperial Army: Reza Naji, [[Mehdi Rahimi]], and [[Manuchehr Khosrowdad]]\nFile:Imam Khomeini and Taleghani (2).jpg|Khomeini before a speech at Alavi school.\n</gallery>\n\n== See also ==\n{{Portal|Islam|Iran|Military history|Politics|1970s}}\nRevolution-related topics:\n* [[Background and causes of the Iranian Revolution]]\n* [[Civil resistance]]\n* [[History of Iran]]\n* [[Ruhollah Khomeini]]\n* [[History of the Islamic Republic of Iran]]\n* [[1979 energy crisis]]\n* [[History of political Islam in Iran]]\n* [[Iran hostage crisis]]\n* [[Organizations of the Iranian Revolution]]\n* [[Guadeloupe conference]]\n* [[Fajr decade]]\nRelated conflicts:\n* [[Persian Constitutional Revolution]]\n* [[1953 Iranian coup d'état]]\n* [[White Revolution]]\n* [[Iran–Iraq war]]\n* [[Kurdish Rebellion of 1983]]\n* [[List of modern conflicts in the Middle East]]\nGeneral:\n* [[Human rights in Islamic Republic of Iran]]\n* [[People's Mujahedin of Iran]]\n* [[Persecution of Bahá'ís]]\n* [[International rankings of Iran]]\n* [[Leftist guerrilla groups of Iran]]\n* [[Island of Stability (speech)]]\n\n==References==\n===Notes===\n{{reflist|group=Note}}\n\n===Citations===\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n=== Bibliography ===\n{{refbegin}}\n* {{Cite book |ref=Arjomand|author=Arjomand, Said Amir |title=Turban for the Crown: The Islamic Revolution in Iran |publisher=Oxford University Press|year=1988 |isbn=0-19-504257-3}}\n* {{Cite book |ref=Abrahamian1982|author=Abrahamian, Ervand |title=Iran between two revolutions|publisher=Princeton University Press|year=1982 |isbn=0-691-00790-X}}\n* {{Cite book |ref=Bakhash|author=Bakhash, Shaul |title=Reign of the Ayatollahs'' |publisher=Basic Books, |year=1984 |isbn=0-465-06888-X }}\n* {{Cite book |ref=Graham|author=Graham, Robert|title=Iran, the Illusion of Power |publisher=St. Martin's Press |year=1980 |isbn=0-312-43588-6}}\n* {{Cite book |ref=Harney|author=Harney, Desmond|title=The priest and the king: an eyewitness account of the Islamic revolution\n|publisher=I.B.

The names were not used immediately and Kit Kat first appeared in the 1920s, when Rowntree's launched a brand of boxed chocolates entitled Kit Cat. This continued into the 1930s, when Rowntree's shifted focus and production onto its [[Black Magic (chocolates)|Black Magic]] and Dairy Box brands. With the promotion of alternative products the Kit Cat brand decreased and was eventually discontinued.<ref name=\"Kk1\">{{cite web|url=http://www.nestle.com/MediaCenter/NewsandFeatures/AllNewsFeatures/Happy-75th-birthday-KitKat.htm |title=Happy 75th birthday Kit Kat] Nestlé |accessdate=10 October 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101015224428/http://www.nestle.com/MediaCenter/NewsandFeatures/AllNewsFeatures/Happy-75th-birthday-KitKat.htm |archivedate=15 October 2010 }}</ref> The original four-finger bar was developed after a worker at Rowntree's York Factory put a suggestion in a recommendation box for a snack that \"a man could take to work in his pack\".<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.yorkpress.co.uk/news/8446094.KitKat___s_75th_anniversary_heralded/|title=KitKat's 75th anniversary heralded|newspaper=[[The Press]]|location=[[Christchurch]], [[New Zealand]]|publisher=[[Fairfax Media]]|date=12 October 2010|accessdate=4 May 2013}}</ref> The bar launched on 29 August 1935, under the title of Rowntree's Chocolate Crisp (priced at [[Old penny sterling|2d]]), and was sold in London and throughout Southern England.<ref name=\"professional\">{{cite web|title=The History of Kit Kat|url=http://www.nestleprofessional.com/uk/en/SiteArticles/Pages/History_of_KitKat.aspx|publisher=[[Nestlé]]|accessdate=4 May 2013}}</ref>\n\nThe product's official title of Rowntree's Chocolate Crisp was renamed Kit Kat Chocolate Crisp in 1937, the same year that Kit Kat began to incorporate \"Break\" into its recognisable advertising strategy.<ref name=\"Kk1\"/> The colour scheme and first flavour variation to the brand came in 1942, owing to [[World War II]], when food shortages prompted an alteration in the recipe. The flavour of Kit Kat was changed to \ndark chocolate; the packaging abandoned its Chocolate Crisp title, and was adorned in blue.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://popsop.com/39282 |title=Kit Kat Turns 75 |publisher=Popsop |location=[[Stevenage]], England |date=11 October 2010 |accessdate=4 May 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130620212415/http://popsop.com/39282 |archivedate=20 June 2013 }}</ref> After the war the title was altered to Kit Kat and resumed its original milk recipe and red packaging.\n\n[[File:KitKat.jpg|thumb|4-finger US Kit Kat|left]]\nFollowing on from its success in the United Kingdom, in the 1940s Kit Kat was exported to Canada, South Africa, Ireland, Australia, and New Zealand. In 1958, Donald Gilles, the executive at JWT Orland, created the iconic advertising line \"Have a Break, Have a Kit Kat\". The brand further expanded in the 1970s when Rowntree created a new distribution factory in Germany to meet European demand, and established agreements to distribute the brand in the USA and Japan through the Hershey and [[Fujiya Co.|Fujiya]] companies, respectively.<ref name=\"Kk1\"/> \n\nIn June 1988, Swiss company Nestlé acquired Kit Kat through the purchase of Rowntree's.

Nestlé, which has a substantial presence in the US, had to honour the licensing agreement when it bought Rowntree in 1988 which allowed Hershey to retain the Kit Kat licence so long as Hershey was not sold. As Kit Kat is one of Hershey's top five brands in the US market, the Kit Kat licence was a key factor in Hershey's failed attempt to attract a serious buyer in 2002.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.confectionerynews.com/Markets/Nestle-quiet-on-Hershey-sale|title=Nestlé quiet on Hershey sale|work=Confectionery News|publisher=[[William Reed Business Media]]|date=5 August 2002|accessdate=5 May 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|last=Sorkin|first=Andrew Ross|agency=[[New York Times]]|url=http://www.sfgate.com/default/article/Possible-buyers-seller-far-apart-on-Hershey-sale-2778035.php|title=Possible buyers, seller far apart on Hershey sale / Price and politics are obstacles|newspaper=[[San Francisco Chronicle]]|publisher=[[Hearst Corporation|Hearst Communications]]|location=San Francisco|date=27 August 2002|accessdate=4 May 2013}}</ref>\n\nVariants in the traditional chocolate bar first appeared in 1996 when Kit Kat Orange, the first flavour variant, was introduced in the United Kingdom. Its success was followed by several varieties including mint and caramel, and in 1999 Kit Kat Chunky was launched and received favourably by international consumers. Variations on the traditional Kit Kat have continued to develop throughout the 2000s. In 2000, Nestlé acquired Fujiya's share of the brand in Japan, and also expanded its marketplace in Japan, Russia, Turkey, and Venezuela, in addition to markets in Eastern and Central Europe.<ref name=\"Kk1\"/> Throughout the decade Kit Kat has introduced dozens of flavours and line extensions within specific consumer markets, and celebrated its 75th anniversary on 10 October 2009.{{Citation needed|date=October 2017}}\n\nThe traditional bar has four fingers which each measure approximately {{convert|1|cm|in|1}} by {{convert|9|cm|in|1}}.

Kit Kat bars contain varying numbers of fingers depending on the market, ranging from the half-finger sized Kit Kat Petit in Japan, to the three-fingered variants in Arabia, to the twelve-finger family-size bars in Australia and France. Kit Kat bars are sold individually and in bags, boxes and multi-packs.

Kit Kat bars in the United States are produced under licence by The Hershey Company, a Nestlé competitor, due to a prior licensing agreement with Rowntree.\nThe year 2003 was a turning point for the Kit Kat bar as well as the confectionery industry in general. The popularity of [[low carb]] diets and the push to healthier eating stifled sales growth in many parts of the world. In addition, fierce competition from [[Cadbury]]'s newly formed [[Cadbury Dairy Milk|Dairy Milk]] superbrand also contributed to sales of the Kit Kat decreasing considerably in its home market of the UK, and threatened to depose it from its No.1 position.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/business/3560857.stm|title=Fat profits: Choc tactics|work=[[BBC News]]|date=24 March 2004|accessdate=4 May 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/health/3315183.stm|title=Consumers 'snub unhealthy brands'|work=[[BBC News]]|publisher=[[BBC|British Broadcasting Corporation]]|location=London|date=13 December 2003|accessdate=4 May 2013}}</ref> The solution adopted by Nestlé and others was to increase dramatically the number of new and unique variations of their confections and market them as [[Special edition|limited or special editions]], whereby they would usually only be available for a few months at a time so as not to impact the sales of their permanent edition counterparts.<ref>{{cite news|last=Uhlig|first=Robert|url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/1454755/Cheesecake-Kit-Kat-Give-us-a-break.html|title=Cheesecake Kit Kat?

As a result of milk shortages after the end of World War II, the milk chocolate coating was suspended and a dark chocolate was used instead during that period.{{Citation needed|date=October 2017}}\n\nSince its introduction in the 1970s, the Hershey's Kit Kat packaging and advertising in the United States differed from the branding used in every other country where it was sold. In 2002, Hershey Kit Kats adopted the slanted [[ellipse]] logo used worldwide by Nestlé, though the ellipse was red and the text white. The US version of \"Kit Kat Chunky\" is known as \"Big Kat\".\n\nIn the United Kingdom, the product has traditionally been wrapped in silver foil and an outer paper band. In 2001, [[flow wrap]] plastic was substituted as the confectionery's packaging.<ref>Suzy Bashford [http://www.marketingmagazine.co.uk/article/73773/brand-health-check-kit-kat---nestle-wise-repackage-kit-kat-kit-kat-shed-its-old-style-foil-paper-covering-flow-wrap-tear-strip-convince-consumers-right-move-asks-suzy-bashford \"BRAND HEALTH CHECK: Kit kat\"], ''Marketing'', 14 June 2001</ref>\n\nIn Norway, a similar product is manufactured by [[Mondelēz International]] and sold as [[Kvikk Lunsj]]; Kvikk Lunsj XXL is similar to a Kit Kat Chunky.\n\n==Marketing and promotion==\nAfter launching in the 1930s, Rowntree's Chocolate Crisp was originally advertised as \"the biggest little meal\" and \"the best companion to a cup of tea\". During World War II, Kit Kat was depicted as a valuable wartime foodstuff, with the slogan \"what active people need\". 'Kitty the Kat' arrived in the late 1940s to emphasise the \"rich full cream milk\" qualities of the bar and, thanks to contemporary improvements in production methods, also highlighted the new and improved 'snap' by responding to a biscuit being broken off screen. The first Kit Kat poster appeared in 1951, and the first colour TV advertisement appeared in 1969.\n\nSince 1958, the slogan for the Kit Kat in the UK and elsewhere has been \"Have a break... have a Kit Kat\". However, in 1995, Nestlé sought to trademark the \"Have a break\" portion. After a ten-year legal battle, which was contested by rival Mars, the [[European Court of Justice]] ruled on 7 July 2005 to send the case back to the [[Courts of the United Kingdom|British courts]].<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2005/07/07/business/worldbusiness/07iht-nestle.html?_r=0|title= Kit Kat slogan dispute sent back to U.K. courts|newspaper=[[International Herald Tribune]]|publisher=[[The New York Times Company]]|location=[[La Défense]], France|date=8 July 2005|accessdate=5 May 2013}}</ref> In 2004, Nestlé UK used the slogan \"Make the most of your break\",<ref>{{cite web|last=Marinovich|first=Slaven|url=http://www.brandchannel.com/features_profile.asp?pr_id=235|title=Kit Kat barred|work=Brand Channel|publisher=[[Interbrand]]|date=6 June 2005|accessdate=5 May 2013|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131203013655/http://www.brandchannel.com/features_profile.asp?pr_id=235|archivedate=3 December 2013|df=dmy-all}}</ref> but later returned to the original slogan.\n\nThe United States also used the short-lived slogan, \"Tastes So Good, You'll Roar\", in the early 1980s. The TV commercial most known from this slogan involves a young man biting into one of the Kit Kat bars in a grocery store, and roaring like a lion so loudly the whole store shakes violently, knocking items from the shelves. Another short-lived US slogan was \"That's What You Want\", whose television adverts showed people pulling unlikely foodstuffs from their pockets or purses, before rejecting them in favour of a Kit Kat.\n\nThe \"classic\" [[United States|American]] version of the \"Gimme a Break\" Kit Kat [[jingle]] (in use in the [[US]] since 1986) was written by [[Ken Shuldman]] (copy) and [[Michael A. Levine]] (music) for the [[DDB Worldwide|DDB Advertising Agency]]. Versions of the original have been covered by [[Carrie Underwood]], [[Shawn Colvin]], and many studio singers, as well as people who have appeared on-camera in the commercials. The jingle was cited in a study by [[University of Cincinnati]] researcher James J. Kellaris as one of the top ten \"[[earworm]]s\" – bits of melody that become stuck in your head. Another version of the advertising jingle 'Gimme a break' created for Kit Kat \"Factory\" commercial in the US was an original recording by [[Andrew W.K.]] W.K. was hired to write a new musical version for their \"Gimme a break\" slogan.

However, the \"classic\" song has also been used again since the newer version first aired in 2004.\n\nA 1989 United Kingdom advertisement for Kit Kat, in which a zoo photographer \"takes a break\" from waiting for pandas to appear in an enclosure and misses them performing a dance routine, came in 30th in [[Channel 4]]'s \"100 Greatest Adverts\" poll in 2000.\n\nThe Maltese tour boat [[HMS Greetham (M2632)|MV ''Lady Davinia'']] had a distinctive red and white Kit Kat paint scheme before she sank in 2008.\n\nIn late 2004 through to the end of 2006, Nestlé Rowntree sponsored the English football club [[York City F.C.]].

The distance was changed in 1896 to its current {{convert|1+1/4|mi|km|abbr=off}}. On May 17, 1875, in front of an estimated crowd of 10,000 people, a field of 15 three-year-old horses contested the first Derby. Under jockey [[Oliver Lewis]], a colt named [[Aristides (horse)|Aristides]], who was trained by future [[National Museum of Racing and Hall of Fame|Hall of Famer]] [[Ansel Williamson]], won the inaugural Derby. Later that year, Lewis rode Aristides to a second-place finish in the [[Belmont Stakes]].\n\nAlthough the first race meeting proved a success, the track ran into financial difficulties and in 1894 the New Louisville Jockey Club was incorporated with new capitalization and improved facilities. Despite this, the business foundered until 1902 when [[Matt Winn|Col. Matt Winn]] of Louisville put together a syndicate of businessmen to acquire the facility. Under Winn, Churchill Downs prospered and the Kentucky Derby then became the preeminent stakes race for three-year-old thoroughbred horses in North America.\n\nDerby participants are limited to three-year-old horses. [[Apollo (horse)|Apollo]] (1882) is the only horse to have won the Derby without having raced at age two.<ref>{{cite web|last=Martin|first=Kevin|title=Longshot Apollo wins the Kentucky Derby, 1882|url=http://colinsghost.org/2012/04/longshot-apollo-wins-the-kentucky-derby-1882.html|publisher=Colin's Ghost|accessdate=February 22, 2014}}</ref>\n\nThoroughbred owners began sending their successful Derby horses to compete a few weeks later in the [[Preakness Stakes]] at the [[Pimlico Race Course]], in [[Baltimore|Baltimore, Maryland]], followed by the [[Belmont Stakes]] in [[Elmont, New York]]. The three races offered the largest purse and in 1919 [[Sir Barton]] became the first horse to win all three races. However, the term [[Triple Crown of Thoroughbred Racing|Triple Crown]] didn't come into use for another eleven years. In 1930, when [[Gallant Fox]] became the second horse to win all three races, sportswriter Charles Hatton brought the phrase into American usage. Fueled by the media, public interest in the possibility of a \"superhorse\" that could win the Triple Crown began in the weeks leading up to the derby. Two years after the term was coined, the race, which had been run in mid-May since inception, was changed to the first Saturday in May to allow for a specific schedule for the Triple Crown races. Since 1931, the order of Triple Crown races has been the Kentucky Derby first, followed by the Preakness Stakes and then the Belmont Stakes. Prior to 1931, eleven times the Preakness was run before the Derby. On May 12, 1917 and again on May 13, 1922, the Preakness and the Derby were run on the same day. On eleven occasions the Belmont Stakes was run before the Preakness Stakes.\n[[File:Churchill Downs 1901.jpg|thumb|right|300px|[[Churchill Downs]] in 1901]]\nOn May 16, 1925, the first live radio broadcast of the Kentucky Derby was originated by [[WHAS (AM)|WHAS]] and was also carried by [[WGN (AM)|WGN]] in Chicago.<ref>\"Derby To Go On The Air\", ''The New York Times'', May 16, 1925, p. 11</ref> On May 7, 1949, the first television coverage of the Kentucky Derby took place, produced by [[WAVE (TV)|WAVE-TV]], the NBC affiliate in Louisville.

In 1968 [[Dancer's Image]] became the first (and to this day the only) horse to win the race and then be disqualified after traces of [[phenylbutazone]], an analgesic and [[Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug|anti-inflammatory drug]], were found in the horse's [[urinalysis]]; [[Forward Pass (horse)|Forward Pass]] won after a protracted legal battle by the owners of [[Dancer's Image]] (which they lost).  [[Forward Pass (horse)|Forward Pass]] thus became the Eighth winner for [[Calumet Farm]]. Unexpectedly, the regulations at Kentucky thoroughbred race tracks were changed some years later, allowing horses to run on [[phenylbutazone]]. In 1970, [[Diane Crump]] became the first female jockey to ride in the Derby, finishing 15th aboard Fathom.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://edition.cnn.com/2012/09/26/sport/diane-crump-first-female-jockey/index.html|title=Jockey who refused to stay in the kitchen - CNN|last=CNN|first=By Sheena McKenzie,|work=CNN|access-date=2018-02-02}}</ref>\n\nThe fastest time ever run in the Derby  was set in 1973 at 1:59.4 minutes when [[Secretariat (horse)|Secretariat]] broke the record set by [[Northern Dancer]] in 1964. Not only has Secretariat's [[World record|record time]] yet to be topped, in the race itself, he did something unique in Triple Crown races: each successive quarter, his times were faster. Though times for non-winners were not recorded, in 1973 Sham finished second, two and a half lengths behind Secretariat in the same race. Using the thoroughbred racing convention of one length equaling one-fifth of a second to calculate [[Sham (horse)|Sham]]'s time, he also finished in under two minutes. Another sub-two-minute finish, only the third, was set in 2001 by [[Monarchos]] at 1:59.97.<ref>{{cite book|last=Dandrea|first=Phil|title=Sham: Great Was Second Best|year=2010|publisher=Acanthus Publishing|url=http://www.ShamHorse.com}}</ref>\n\nThe 2004 Derby marked the first time that jockeys, as a result of a [[court order]], were allowed to wear corporate advertising logos on their clothing.\n\nIn 2005, the [[purse distribution]] for the Derby was changed, so that horses finishing fifth would henceforth receive a share of the purse; previously only the first four finishers did so.\n\nNorman Adams has been the designer of the Kentucky Derby Logo since 2002. On February 1, 2006, the Louisville-based [[fast food|fast-food]] company [[Yum! Brands, Inc.]] announced a corporate sponsorship deal to call the race \"The Kentucky Derby presented by Yum!

The [[mint julep]], an iced drink consisting of [[bourbon whiskey|bourbon]], [[mentha|mint]], and a [[sugar]] syrup, is the traditional beverage of the race. The historic drink can be served in an ice-frosted silver julep cup, but most Churchill Downs patrons sip theirs from souvenir glasses (first offered in 1939 and available in revised form each year since) printed with all previous Derby winners.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Sneed|first1=Tierney|title=The Origin of Your Favorite Kentucky Derby Traditions|url=https://www.usnews.com/news/articles/2013/05/03/the-origin-of-your-favorite-kentucky-derby-traditions|website=usnews.com|accessdate=3 July 2016}}</ref> Also, [[burgoo]], a thick stew of beef, chicken, pork, and vegetables, is a popular Kentucky dish served at the Derby.\n[[File:Louisville Clock.jpg|thumb|right|250px|[[Louisville Clock]] (often called the Louisville Derby Clock)]]\n\nThe infield, a spectator area inside the track, offers general admission prices but little chance of seeing much of the race. Instead, revelers show up in the infield to party with abandon. By contrast, \"Millionaire's Row\" refers to the expensive box seats that attract the rich, the famous and the well-connected. Women appear in fine outfits lavishly accessorized with large, elaborate hats. As the horses are paraded before the grandstands, the [[University of Louisville]] [[The University of Louisville Marching Band|Marching Band]] plays [[Stephen Foster]]'s \"[[My Old Kentucky Home]],\" a tradition which began in 1921.<ref>{{cite web|title=My Old Kentucky Home|url=http://www.kentuckyderby.com/experience/traditions/song-my-old-kentucky-home}}</ref> The event attracts spectators from a large area, flying in hundreds of private aircraft to [[Louisville International Airport]].<ref name=ain2015-05-05>{{cite news |first=Curt |last=Epstein |url=http://www.ainonline.com/aviation-news/business-aviation/2015-05-05/derby-boxing-match-fuel-atlantics-best-day-ever |title=Derby, Boxing Match Fuel Atlantic's Best Day Ever |work=Aviation International News |date=5 May 2015 |accessdate=6 May 2015 }}</ref>\n\nThe Derby is frequently referred to as \"''The Run for the Roses'',\" because a lush blanket of 554 red [[rose]]s is awarded to the Kentucky Derby winner each year. The tradition originated in 1883 when [[New York City|New York]] socialite E. Berry Wall presented roses to ladies at a post-Derby party that was attended by Churchill Downs founder and president, Col. M. Lewis Clark. This gesture is believed to have led Clark to the idea of making the rose the race's official flower. However, it was not until 1896 that any recorded account referred to roses being draped on the Derby winner. The [[Governor of Kentucky]] awards the garland and the [[Kentucky Derby Trophy]]. Pop vocalist [[Dan Fogelberg]] composed the song \"[[Run for the Roses (song)|Run for the Roses]]\" which was released in time for the 1980 running of the race.<ref>{{cite web|title=Dan Fogelberg Prodigy Chat transcript Treehouse.org|url=http://www.treehouse.org/fogelberg/intview7.html|accessdate=October 16, 2014}}</ref>\n\n==Records==\n'''Most wins by a [[jockey]]'''\n* 5 – [[Eddie Arcaro]] (1938, 1941, 1945, 1948, 1952)\n* 5 – [[Bill Hartack]] (1957, 1960, 1962, 1964, 1969)\n\n'''Most wins by a [[Horse trainer|trainer]]'''\n* 6 – [[Ben A.

The brutality of this race can be readily understood by comparing the list of teams who set off from the start line against the roster of cars that survive for the full duration.  Of the 60 cars which qualified for the 2017 race, only 49 cars ran the full duration successfully.<ref>https://www.motorsport.com/wec/results/2017/le-mans-24-hours-162895/</ref>\n\nSince 2012, the 24 Hours of Le Mans has been a part of the [[FIA World Endurance Championship]]. In 2017, it will be the third round of the season.\n\nOver the years, Le Mans influenced events have sprung up all around the globe, popularizing the 24-hour format at places like [[24 Hours of Daytona|Daytona]], [[24 Hours Nürburgring|Nürburgring]], [[Spa 24 Hours|Spa-Francorchamps]], and [[Bathurst 24 Hour|Bathurst]]. The [[American Le Mans Series]] and Europe's [[Le Mans Series]] of multi-event sports car championships were spun off from 24 Hours of Le Mans regulations. Other races include the [[Le Mans Classic]], a race for historic Le Mans race cars from years' past held on the Circuit de la Sarthe, a [[24 Hours of Le Mans (motorcycle race)|motorcycle version of the race]] which is held on the shortened Bugatti version of the same circuit, a kart race (24 Heures Karting), a truck race (24 Heures Camions), and a parody race [[24 Hours of LeMons]].\n\nThe '''[[2017 24 Hours of Le Mans]]''' ({{lang-fr|link=no|85<sup>e</sup> 24 Heures du Mans}}) was held on June 17–18 at the [[Circuit de la Sarthe]], [[Le Mans]], [[France]]. [[Porsche in motorsport|Porsche]] claimed their 19th overall victory with drivers [[Timo Bernhard]], [[Brendon Hartley]], and [[Earl Bamber]] piloting the [[Porsche 919 Hybrid]].\n\n==Purpose==\nAt a time when [[Grand Prix motor racing]] was the dominant form of motorsport throughout Europe, Le Mans was designed to present a different test. Instead of focusing on the ability of a car company to build the fastest machines, the 24 Hours of Le Mans would instead concentrate on the ability of manufacturers to build sporty yet reliable cars. This encouraged innovation in producing reliable and [[Fuel economy in automobiles|fuel-efficient vehicles]], because [[Endurance racing (motorsport)|endurance racing]] requires cars that last and spend as little time in the pits as possible.\n\nAt the same time, the layout of the track necessitated cars with better aerodynamics and stability at high speeds. While this was shared with Grand Prix racing, few tracks in Europe had straights of a length comparable to the [[Mulsanne Straight|Mulsanne]]. Additionally, because the road is public and thus not as meticulously maintained as permanent racing circuits, racing puts more strain on the parts, increasing the importance of reliability.\n\nThe [[1973 oil crisis|oil crisis]] in the early 1970s led organizers to adopt a fuel economy formula known as [[Group C]] that limited the amount of fuel each car was allowed. Although it was later abandoned, fuel economy remains important as new fuel sources reduced time spent during pit stops. Such technological innovations have had a trickle-down effect and can be incorporated into consumer cars. This has also led to faster and more exotic [[supercar]]s as manufacturers seek to develop faster road cars in order to develop them into even faster GT cars.\n\nAdditionally, in recent years hybrid systems (flywheel, super-capacitor, battery coupled with both gasoline and diesel) have been championed in the LMP category as rules have been changed to their benefit and to further push efficiency.\n\n==The race==\nThe race is held in June, leading at times to very hot conditions for drivers, particularly in closed vehicles with poor ventilation; rain is commonly seen. The race begins in mid-afternoon and finishes the following day at the same hour the race started the previous day.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.lemans.org/en/races/24h/handy-information/schedule-week.html | title=Schedule | publisher=lemans.org | accessdate=22 April 2011 | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110807100830/http://www.lemans.org/en/races/24h/handy-information/schedule-week.html | archivedate=7 August 2011 | df=dmy-all }}</ref> Over the 24 hours, modern competitors often cover distances well over {{convert|5000|km|mi|sigfig=3|abbr=on}}.

It also tests endurance, with drivers frequently racing for over two hours before a relief driver can take over during a pit stop while they eat and rest. Current regulations mandate that three drivers share each competing vehicle.\n\nCompeting teams race in groups called \"classes\", or cars of similar specification, while also competing simultaneously for outright placing amongst all classes. Originally, the race showcased cars as they were sold to the general public, then called \"Sports Cars\", in contrast with the specialized [[race car|racing cars]] used in [[Grand Prix motor racing]]. Over time, the competing vehicles evolved away from their publicly available road car roots, and today the race is made of two overall classes: prototypes, and Grand Touring cars (similar to sports cars sold to the public).  These are further broken down into 2 sub-classes each,  constructors' prototypes, privateer prototypes and 2 subclasses of GT cars.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.lemans.org/en/races/24h/discover-endurance/introduction.html | title=Two major car families | publisher=lemans.org | accessdate=22 April 2011 | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110807090320/http://www.lemans.org/en/races/24h/discover-endurance/introduction.html | archivedate=7 August 2011 | df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n\nCompeting teams have had a wide variety of organization, ranging from competition departments of road car manufacturers (eager to prove the supremacy of their products) to professional motor racing teams (representing their commercial backers, some of which are also car manufacturers who want to win without paying for their own teams) to amateur teams (racing as much to compete in the famous race as to claim victory for their commercial partners).\n\nThe race has also spent long periods as a round of the [[World Sportscar Championship]], although Le Mans has always had a stronger reputation than the World Championship, and is a round of the [[FIA World Endurance Championship]]. The race is also known as a leg of the informal [[Triple Crown of Motorsport]] which links [[Formula One]], [[IndyCar]], and [[sports car racing]] to represent a career achievement for drivers. Additionally, it is seen as a leg of the [[Triple Crown (endurance racing)|Triple Crown of endurance racing]], which links the three largest sports car races together, with [[12 Hours of Sebring]] and [[24 Hours of Daytona]] forming the other legs.  Since 1998, the American Le Mans Series holds a second endurance race along with the 12 hours of Sebring every year called \"[[Petit Le Mans]]\", as a 10-hour American version. In 2014, the [[United SportsCar Championship|Tudor Sports Car Championship]] (a merger of the races at Sebring; [[Petit Le Mans]] in [[Braselton]], Georgia; the [[6 Hours of Watkins Glen]] in [[Watkins Glen, New York|Watkins Glen]], New York; and the [[Rolex Sports Car Series]]' [[24 Hours of Daytona]]) held all four major American endurance classics in preparation for teams to race at [[Le Mans]].\n\n===Cars===\n[[File:Andy Prialux Dirk Muller Joey Hand BMW Motorsport LMGTE Pro BMW M3 Le Mans 2011.jpg|thumb|A [[BMW M3]] GT2 at the 24 Hours of Le Mans]]\nThe race has approximately 60 competitors. Each car was required to have at least two seats, but recently cars only need the ability to accommodate a second seat in the cockpit rather than the seat itself. No more than two doors are allowed; open cockpit cars do not require doors. Since 2014, all cars in the premier LMP1 category must have a roof due to safety concerns, with open-cockpit cars only permitted in the slightly slower LMP2 category. Since 2017, all prototype cars, LMP1 or LMP2, must have closed cockpits.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://auto-racing.speedtv.com/article/le-mans-inside-the-2014-lmp1-regulations/ |title=LE MANS: Inside The 2014 LMP1 Regulations |publisher=Auto-racing.speedtv.com |date=2012-11-27 |accessdate=2013-08-05 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130710021103/http://auto-racing.speedtv.com/article/le-mans-inside-the-2014-lmp1-regulations |archivedate=10 July 2013 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n\nAlthough all cars compete at the same time, there are separate classes. A prize is awarded to the winner of each class, and to the overall winner. The number of classes has varied over the years, but there are now four. Custom-built [[Le Mans Prototype]]s (LMP) are the top two classes, LMP1 and LMP2, divided by speed, weight, and power output. From 2011, the next two classes are production-based [[grand tourer]] (GT) classes, GT Endurance Pro and GT Endurance AM. Both of these classes utilize the [[LM GTE]], or \"Le Mans Grand Touring Endurance\" regulations. Although the top class is the most likely to be the overall winner, lower classes have won on occasion due to better reliability.\n\n===Drivers===\nOriginally, there were no rules on the number of drivers of a car, or how long they could drive. Although almost all teams used two drivers in the early decades, some Le Mans drivers such as [[Pierre Levegh]] and [[E.R. Hall|Eddie Hall]] attempted to run the race solo, hoping to save time by not having to change drivers. This practice was later banned. Until the 1980s, there were teams in which only two drivers competed, but by the end of the decade, the rules were changed to stipulate that at least three drivers must drive each car.\n\nBy the 1990s, due to the speeds of the cars and the strain it puts on drivers, additional rules to reduce driver fatigue mandated that drivers could not drive for over 240 minutes over a 6-hour period, and that no one driver could run for over 14 hours total. With careful management of driver stints, this makes it possible to complete the race with only two drivers (as [[Jeroen Bleekemolen]] and Cooper MacNeil did in 2014), although the vast majority of teams still continue to use three drivers.<ref>http://www.24h-lemans.com/en/race/historical_2_2_2501.html?recherche=1&annee=2014&nbparpage=9#topContent</ref><ref>http://www.racer.com/wec-le-mans/item/104435-lm24-iron-man-rotation-for-macneil-and-bleekemolen</ref>\n\n===Traditions and unique rules===\nAlthough it has been a part of the [[World Sportscar Championship]] for most of its existence, the race has had different regulations for safety and competition reasons partly due to its length. For many decades, cars were required to run at least an hour into the race before they were allowed to refill fluids for the car, such as oil or coolant, with the exception of fuel. This was an attempt by the ACO to help increase efficiency and reliability. Cars which could not last the first hour without having to replace lost fluids were disqualified.\n\nAnother rule unique to Le Mans is that cars must be switched off while they are refuelled in the pits. Not only is this safer and less of a fire hazard, but it is also another test of reliability, as cars with the ability to restart many times under race conditions are harder. Another element of this rule is that mechanics are not allowed to work on the car while it is being refuelled (other than helping a driver in or out of the car), which has led teams to adapt innovative ways in which to decrease the time of these lengthy pit stops. Drivers are allowed to get out of the car and be replaced by another driver during refuelling. Those rules are also in application in the [[FIA World Endurance Championship]].\n\nThere are various long-standing traditions at Le Mans, including the waving of the [[Flag of France|French tricolor]] to start the race. This is usually followed by a fly-over featuring jets trailing blue, white and red smoke. A similar flag tradition is the waving of safety flags during the final lap of the race by track marshals, congratulating the winners and other finishers.{{citation needed|date=May 2014}}\n\nLe Mans was the venue for the first televised instance of a winning driver celebrating by spraying champagne instead of drinking it.<ref name=\"Miscellany pg 82\">G.

The race has been cancelled ten times—in 1936 (a labour strike during the [[Great Depression]]) and between 1940 and 1948 (World War II).\n\nThe race usually takes place on the second weekend of June, with qualifying and practice taking place on the Wednesday and Thursday before the race, following a car inspection on Monday and Tuesday. Currently, these sessions are held in the evening, with two separate two-hour sessions held each night. Friday serves as a day of rest and a parade of all the drivers through [[Le Mans]] is held.\n\nTest days  held at the end of April or beginning of May served as a pre-qualification weeding out the slowest cars. However, in 2005 the exorbitant cost of transporting cars to and from Le Mans led organizers to move the test day to the first weekend of June. In fact pre-qualification was eliminated in 2000, meaning that all competitors invited to the test would be allowed into the race.\n\nSince 2001 the [[Le Mans Legend]] races have also been part of the schedule, usually running exhibition races during qualifying days, a few hours prior to the sessions for the Le Mans entrants.\n\nUntil 2008, the race started at 16:00 on Saturday (though in 1968, the race started at 14:00 due to the lateness of the race on the calendar. In 1984 and 2007, the start time was moved ahead to 15:00 due to the conflicting [[French presidential election, 2007|election]]). In 2006, the ACO scheduled a 17:00 start time on Saturday, 17 June in order to maximize television coverage in between the [[2006 FIFA World Cup|World Cup]] games. Since 2009, when the race took place from 13–14 June, it starts at 15:00 local time (13:00 GMT).\n\n[[Image:Le Mans 2008 Rolling start.jpg|thumb|right|Rolling start of the {{24hLM|2008}} race]]\n\n====Classification====\nOriginally, the car that covered the greatest distance from its starting position was the winner. This is known to have caught out the [[Ford Motor Company|Ford]] team in {{24hLM|1966}}. With a dominant 1–2 lead, the two cars slowed to allow for a [[photo opportunity]] at the finish line, with [[Ken Miles]] slightly ahead of [[Bruce McLaren]]. However, since McLaren's car had actually started much farther back on the grid than Miles's, McLaren's car had actually covered the greatest distance over the 24 hours. With the margin of victory determined to be eight metres, McLaren and his co-driver, [[Chris Amon]], were declared the winners. The decision cost Miles and [[Denny Hulme]] a victory. Miles had already won the other two endurance races at Sebring and Daytona. With a win at Le Mans, he would have become not only the first man to win all three, but the first to win them all in the same year.\n\nThe \"greatest distance\" rule was modified with the introduction of a rolling start in 1971, and now the car that completes the greatest distance as of the completion of the final lap – where \"greatest distance\" is measured by the start/finish line for all competitors – wins. When two cars finish the same number of laps, their finishing order is determined by the faster overall completion time. This rule was used in the [[2011 24 Hours of Le Mans]] to determine the race winner, when the top two finishers both completed 355 laps, with only 13 seconds difference between them.<ref>{{Citation|last=Fredstar88|title=Final Lap of 24 Hours of Le Mans 2011|date=2011-06-12|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UCs8Nvt65uU|accessdate=2016-07-02}}</ref>\n\nAlthough \"greatest distance run\" determines the provisional order of finishers, additional requirements must be met for a car to be classified.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.fiawec.com/presentation/regulation.html|title=Regulation {{!}} FIA World Endurance Championship|website=www.fiawec.com|access-date=2016-07-02}}</ref>\n* A car must complete the last lap of the race, and must complete the entire circuit faster than a prescribed maximum lap time.  Ambiguity in this classification requirement has led to dramatic scenes where damaged cars have waited in the pits or on the edge of the track close to the finish line, then restarted their engines and crawled across the line to be listed amongst classified finishers.{{Citation needed|date=July 2010}} The practice of intentionally \"waiting for the final lap\" in this manner has been prohibited by rule in recent years.\n* Cars must complete 70 percent of the distance covered by the overall winner to be classified. A car failing to complete this number of laps, even if it finishes the last lap of the race, is not deemed worthy of classification because of poor reliability or speed.\nAll classification requirements hold except in exceptional circumstances, as determined by the race stewards.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n====Le Mans start====\n{{Further|Standing start}}\n[[Image:Lemans Circuit Bugatti.JPG|thumb|right|The permanent pits and pit straight for both the ''[[Circuit de la Sarthe]]'' and Bugatti Circuit]]\n\nThe race traditionally began with what became known as the ''Le Mans start'', in which cars were lined up along the length of the pits. Until 1962, cars were lined up in order of engine capacity, but beginning in 1963 qualifying times determined the lineup. The starting drivers stood on the opposite side of the front stretch. When the French flag dropped to signify the start, the drivers ran across the track, entered and started their cars without assistance, and drove away. This became a safety issue in the late 1960s when some drivers ignored their safety harnesses, then a recent invention. This led to drivers running the first few laps either improperly harnessed due to attempting to do it while driving or sometimes not even harnessed at all, leading to several deaths when cars were involved in accidents due to the bunched field at the start.\n\nThis starting method inspired [[Porsche]] to locate the ignition key switch to the left of the steering wheel. In a left-hand drive car, this allowed the driver to use his left hand to start the engine, and his right hand to put the [[Transmission (mechanics)|transmission]] into gear, which in turn shaves off a few tenths of a second.\n\nAnother method for speeding up the start was developed by [[Stirling Moss]]. His car was waiting with first gear already engaged. When he jumped in, he switched the starter on without depressing the clutch. The car was immediately jerked forward by the starter motor, but the engine did not start due to low RPM. After a few seconds of motion, he then pushed the clutch down, allowing the engine to speed up and start while the car was moving.\n\nFeeling this type of start was unsafe, in the {{24hLM|1969}} race, [[Jacky Ickx]] opposed it by walking across the track while his competitors ran. Although he was nearly hit by a faster competitor's car while walking, Ickx took the time to fasten his safety belts before pulling away. Privateer [[John Woolfe]] died in an accident on the first lap of that race; Ickx won.\n\nThe traditional Le Mans start was changed for {{24hLM|1970}}. Cars were still lined up along the pit wall, but the drivers were already inside and strapped in. At the dropping of the French tricolor, the drivers started their engines and drove away. Since 1971, when that method was done away with, a [[rolling start]] (sometimes known as an ''[[Indianapolis 500|Indianapolis]] start'') begins the race.<ref name=\"24 key dates for the 24 Hours\">{{cite web|title=24 key dates for the 24 Hours|url=http://www.lemans.org/en/news/24-key-dates-for-the-24-hours_6843.html|publisher=ACO|accessdate=20 April 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120422191720/http://www.lemans.org/en/news/24-key-dates-for-the-24-hours_6843.html|archivedate=22 April 2012|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\n==The circuit==\n[[Image:Circuit de la Sarthe track map.svg|thumb|right|The [[Circuit de la Sarthe]] with the [[Bugatti Circuit]] (dashed line)]]\n{{Main|Circuit de la Sarthe}}\nThe circuit on which the 24 Hours of Le Mans is run is named the [[Circuit de la Sarthe]], after the [[Departments of France|department]] that Le Mans is within. It consists of both permanent track and public roads that are temporarily closed for the race. Since 1923, the track has been extensively modified, mostly for safety reasons, and now is {{convert|13.626|km|3|abbr=on}} in length. Although it initially entered the town of Le Mans, the track was cut short in order to better protect spectators. This led to the creation of the [[Dunlop Tyres|Dunlop]] Curve and Tertre Rouge corners before rejoining the old circuit on the [[Mulsanne]]. Another major change was on the Mulsanne itself in 1990, when the [[FIA]] decreed that it would no longer sanction any circuit that had a straight longer than {{convert|2|km|1|abbr=on}}. To comply with this, two [[chicanes]] were added to the 6 km long straight. The addition of the chicanes was further influenced by the fact that the speed of [[Welter Racing|WM P88]]-[[PNV engine|Peugeot]] French driver [[Roger Dorchy]] had been timed at {{convert|405|kph|0|abbr=on}} during the [[1988 24 Hours of Le Mans|1988]] race.\n\nDue to the shorter length of the straights, top speeds at Le Mans are now generally around {{convert|205|mph|0|abbr=on}}.\n\nThe public sections of the track differ from the permanent circuit, especially in comparison with the [[Bugatti Circuit]] which is inside the Circuit de la Sarthe. Due to heavy traffic in the area, the public roads are not as smooth or well kept. They also offer less grip because of the lack of soft-tyre rubber laid down from racing cars, though this only affects the first few laps of the race. The roads are closed only within a few hours of the practice sessions and the race, before being opened again almost as soon as the race is finished. Workers have to assemble and dismantle safety barriers every year for the public sections.\n\n==History==\n:''For a list of individual race reports, see [[:Category:24 Hours of Le Mans races]].''\n\n===1923–1939===\n[[Image:1923Lemans.JPG|thumb|A poster for the [[1923 24 Hours of Le Mans]]]]\n\nThe 24 Hours of Le Mans was first run on 26 and 27 May 1923, through public roads around Le Mans. Originally planned to be a three-year event awarded the [[Rudge-Whitworth]] Triennial Cup, with a winner being declared by the car which could go the farthest distance over three consecutive 24-hour races, this idea was abandoned in 1928 and overall winners were declared for each single year depending on who covered the farthest distance by the time 24 hours were up. The early races were dominated by French, British, and Italian drivers, teams, and cars, with [[Bugatti]], [[Bentley]], and [[Alfa Romeo]] being the top brands. Innovations in car design began appearing at the track in the late 1930s, with Bugatti and Alfa Romeo running highly aerodynamic bodywork in order to run down the [[Mulsanne Straight]] at faster speeds. The race was cancelled in 1936 due to [[Matignon Agreements (1936)|general strikes in France]], and the outbreak of [[World War II]] in 1939 resulted in a ten-year hiatus.\n\n===1949–1969===\nFollowing the reconstruction of circuit facilities, the race was resumed in 1949<ref name=\"24 key dates for the 24 Hours\" /> with renewed interest from major automobile manufacturers. 1949 was also [[Ferrari]]'s first victory, the [[Ferrari 166 S|166MM]] of [[Luigi Chinetti]] and [[Peter Mitchell-Thomson, 2nd Baron Selsdon|Peter Mitchell-Thomson]].<ref name=\"24 key dates for the 24 Hours\" /> After the formation of the [[World Sportscar Championship]] in 1953, of which Le Mans was a part, Ferrari, [[Aston Martin]], [[Mercedes-Benz]], [[Jaguar (car)|Jaguar]] and many others began sending multiple cars backed by their respective factories to compete for overall wins against their competitors. This competitiveness sometimes resulted in tragedy, as in the [[1955 Le Mans disaster]] during the {{24hLM|1955}} race in which [[Pierre Levegh]]'s car crashed into a crowd of spectators, killing more than 80&nbsp;people. The incident led to the widespread introduction of safety measures, not only at the circuit, but elsewhere in the motorsport world. Following the accident, the entire pit complex was razed and rebuilt further back allowing the pit straight to be widened, although there was still no barrier between the track and the pit lane. Safety standards improved but the cars got faster, and the move from open-cockpit roadsters to closed-cockpit coupés resulted in speeds of over {{convert|320|km/h}} on the Mulsanne. Ford entered the picture with the [[Ford GT40|GT40]], finally ending Ferrari's dominance with four straight wins (1966-1969) before the 1960s ended and the cars, and the race, changed substantially.\n\n===1970–1980===\n[[Image:Renault Alpine A443 Donington 2007.jpg|thumb|right|[[Renault Alpine A443]] from 1978]]\nFor the new decade, the race took a turn towards more extreme speeds and automotive designs. These extreme speeds led to the replacement of the typical standing ''Le Mans start'' with a rolling ''Indianapolis start''. Although production-based cars still raced, they were now in the lower classes while purpose-built sportscars became the norm. The [[Porsche 917]], [[Porsche 935|935]], and [[Porsche 936|936]] were dominant throughout the decade, but a resurgence by French manufacturers [[Equipe Matra Sports|Matra]]-[[Simca]] and [[Renault]] saw the first victories for the nation since the 1950 race. This decade is also remembered for strong performances from many privateer constructors, with two scoring the only victories for a privateer, in the decade. [[John Wyer]]'s [[Mirage (race car)|Mirage]] won in {{24hLM|1975}}, while [[Jean Rondeau]]'s self-titled chassis took {{24hLM|1980}}.\n\n===1981–1993===\n[[Image:Porsche 962 1988 Le Mans at Silverstone 2007.JPG|thumb|[[Group C]] [[Porsche 962]] from 1988]]\nThe rest of the 1980s was known for the dominance by Porsche under the new [[Group C]] race car formula that encouraged fuel efficiency. Originally running the effective [[Porsche 956|956]], it was later replaced by the [[Porsche 962|962]]. Both chassis were affordable enough for privateers to purchase them en masse, leading to the two model types winning six years in a row. Jaguar and Mercedes-Benz returned to sports car racing, with Jaguar being the first to break Porsche's dominance with victories in 1988 and 1990 (with the [[XJR-9]] and [[Jaguar XJR-12]] respectively). Mercedes-Benz won in 1989, with what was seen as the latest incarnation of the elegant \"[[Silver Arrows]]\", the [[Sauber C9]], while an influx of Japanese manufacturer interest saw prototypes from [[Nissan]] and [[Toyota]]. In 1988 too, a [[Welter Racing|W.M.]] [[Peugeot]] set up a new record speeding at 405&nbsp;km/h (252&nbsp;mph) in the ''Ligne Droite des Hunaudières'', famous for its 6&nbsp;km (3.7&nbsp;mi) long straight.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.24h-lemans.com/en/news/24-hours-of-mans-the-records-to-be-beaten_2_2_1746_11149.html | title=THE RECORDS TO BE BEATEN | publisher=24h-lemans.com | accessdate=11 June 2014 }}</ref> [[Mazda]] would be the only Japanese manufacturer to succeed, with their unique [[Wankel engine|rotary]]-powered [[Mazda 787B|787B]] winning in 1991.\n\n[[File:Peugeot905 evo1ter 1993.jpg|thumb|[[Peugeot 905]] from 1993]]\nIn 1992 and 1993, Peugeot dominated the race with its [[Peugeot 905]] as the Group C formula and [[World Sportscar Championship]] were fading in participation.\n\nThe circuit would also undergo one of its most notable changes in {{24hLM|1990}}, when the 5&nbsp;km long Mulsanne was modified<ref name=\"24 key dates for the 24 Hours\" /> to include two chicanes in order to stop speeds of more than {{Convert|400|km/h|mi/h|0|abbr=on}} from being reached. This began a trend by the ACO to attempt to slow the cars on various portions of the track; although speeds over {{Convert|320|km/h|mi/h|0|abbr=on}} are still regularly reached at various points on a lap.\n\n===1994–1999===\nFollowing the demise of the [[World Sportscar Championship]], Le Mans saw a resurgence of production-based [[grand tourer]] cars. Thanks to a loophole in the rules, Porsche succeeded in convincing the ACO that a [[Dauer 962 Le Mans]] supercar was a production car, allowing Porsche to race their [[Porsche 962]] for one final time, dominating the field. Although the ACO attempted to close the loop hole for 1995, newcomer [[McLaren Cars|McLaren]] would win the race in their supercar's first appearance thanks to the reliability of the BMW V12 powered F1 GTR, beating faster yet more trouble-prone prototypes. The trend would continue through the 1990s as more exotic supercars were built in order to skirt the ACO's rules regarding production-based race cars, leading to [[Porsche]], [[Mercedes-Benz]], [[Toyota]], [[Nissan]], [[Panoz]], and [[Lotus Cars|Lotus]] entering the GT categories. This culminated in the {{24hLM|1999}} event, in which these GT cars were faced with the [[Le Mans Prototype]]s of [[BMW]], [[Audi]], and [[Ferrari]]. BMW would survive with the victory, their first and only overall Le Mans win to date, whilst Mercedes left sportscar racing indefinitely following a series of severe aerodynamic flaws <!--\"leading to several fatal accidents\"?--> with their [[Mercedes-Benz CLR|CLR]].\n\nThis strong manufacturer influence led the ACO to lending the Le Mans name to a sports car series in the United States in 1999, known as the [[American Le Mans Series]], which ran until the end of the [[2013 American Le Mans Series season|2013]] season after which it merged with [[Grand-Am Road Racing|Grand-Am]] to form the [[United SportsCar Championship]].\n\n===2000–2005===\n[[Image:Audi R10 1.JPG|thumb|left|A [[diesel engine|diesel]]-powered [[Audi R10 TDI]]]]\nMany major automobile manufacturers withdrew from sports car racing after 1999 due to the high cost. Only Cadillac and Audi remained, and Audi easily dominated with the [[Audi R8 (race car)|R8]]. Cadillac pulled out three years later, and attempts by Panoz, [[Chrysler]], and [[MG (car)|MG]] to beat Audi all fell short. After three victories in a row, Audi provided engine, team staff, and drivers to [[Bentley]], a corporate partner, which had returned in 2001, and in 2003 the factory [[Bentley Speed 8]]s beat privateer Audis. The Chevrolet Corvette Racing Team and their C5-R won several times in the GTS class, finishing 1st & 2nd in 2001, 2002, and 2004. They finished 2nd & 3rd in 2003.\n\n===Since 2006===\nAt the end of 2005, after five overall victories for the R8, and six to its V8 turbo engine, Audi took on a new challenge by introducing a [[diesel engine]]d prototype known as the [[Audi R10 TDI|R10 TDI]]. Although not the first diesel to race, it was the first to win at Le Mans. This era saw other alternative fuel sources being used, including [[bio-ethanol]], while Peugeot decided to follow Audi's lead and also pursue a diesel entry in 2007 with their [[Peugeot 908 HDi FAP|908 HDi FAP]].\n\nIn the [[2008 24 Hours of Le Mans|2008 race]] between the [[Audi R10 TDI]] and the [[Peugeot 908 HDi FAP]], the Audi won by a margin of less than 10 minutes. For the [[2009 24 Hours of Le Mans]], Peugeot introduced a new energy-recovery system similar to the [[Kinetic energy recovery system|KERS]] used in [[Formula One]].<ref>{{cite news|title= 908 HY to close Le Mans Series in hybrid style|publisher=AutoBlog}}</ref> Aston Martin entered the [[LMP1]] category, but still raced in [[FIA GT1 World Championship|GT1]] with private teams. Audi returned with the new R15 TDI, but  Peugeot prevailed in its first overall win since 1993.\n\nThe [[2010 24 Hours of Le Mans|2010]] running reaffirmed the race as a test of endurance and reliability. In adjusting their cars and engines to adhere to the 2010 regulations, Peugeot chose overall speed while Audi chose reliability. At the end of the race, all four Peugeots had retired, three due to engine failure, while Audi finished 1-2-3.\n\nThe [[2011 24 Hours of Le Mans|2011]] and [[2012 24 Hours of Le Mans|2012]] races were marred by a series of accidents. In 2011, in the first hour, the Audi driven by Allan McNish crashed heavily, barrel rolling into a tire wall shortly after the [[Dunlop Bridge]]. At night, the defending race-winning Audi driven by [[Mike Rockenfeller]] crashed in similar fashion between the Mulsanne and Indianapolis corners. Neither driver was injured, nor were any spectators. The third Audi entry driven by [[Marcel Fässler (racing driver)|Marcel Fässler]], [[André Lotterer]], and [[Benoît Tréluyer]] won the race. The 2012 race saw two factory Toyotas replace Peugeot, which had withdrawn earlier, but one of them flipped at Mulsanne Corner. Driver [[Anthony Davidson]] suffered two broken vertebrae but was able to exit the car himself. The other Toyota retired with mechanical difficulties shortly after sunset, giving Audi another victory.\n\nIn 2011, the race became the premier round of the [[Intercontinental Le Mans Cup]], an attempt to make a world championship for endurance racing again. In [[2012 24 Hours of Le Mans|2012]], the race became the centerpiece of the [[FIA World Endurance Championship]], the successor to the ILMC. The 2012 event was the first time the race was won by a [[hybrid electric vehicle]], which was the [[Audi R18#R18 e-tron quattro|Audi R18 e-tron quattro]].\n\nAfter Audi's dominance of the event in the early 2000s, Toyota has fielded competitive cars since 2012, Porsche returned to Le Mans in 2014 with a new factory LMP1 program, and Nissan returned to run an LMP1 program in 2015. Audi withdrew from racing at the 24 Hours of Le Mans in 2016 and Nissan only after one attempt in 2015.\n\nPorsche won the race in 2015, 2016 and 2017 with its [[Hybrid electric vehicle|hybrid]] [[Porsche 919 Hybrid|919]], and remains the most successful manufacturer at Le Mans, with 19 overall victories, including a seven straight from 1981 to 1987.\n\n==Innovations==\nLe Mans has seen many innovations in [[automotive design]] to counteract the circuit's difficulties. These have either been dictated by rules or have been attempts by manufacturers to outwit the competition. Some innovations were incorporated into the common automobile.\n\n===Aerodynamics===\n[[Image:Porsche 908 Langheck am 1981-08-15.jpg|thumb|right|A [[Porsche 908|Porsche 908 ''Langheck'']]]]\nOne of the keys to Le Mans is top speed, caused by the long straights that dominate the circuit. This has meant cars have attempted to achieve the maximum speeds possible instead of relying on downforce for the turns. While early competitors' cars were street cars with their bodywork removed to reduce weight, innovators like [[Bugatti]] developed cars which saw the beginnings of aerodynamics. Nicknamed ''tanks'' due to their similarity to military tanks in World War I, these cars used simple curves to cover all the mechanical elements of the car and increase top speed. Once Le Mans returned after World War II, most manufacturers would adopt closed bodies which were streamlined for better aerodynamics. A notable example in the changes brought about by aerodynamics are the 1950 entries by [[Briggs Cunningham]]. Cunningham entered two 1950 [[Cadillac Coupe de Ville]]s, one nearly stock and the other completely rebodied in a streamlined aluminum shape developed by [[Grumman|Grumman Aircraft Engineering Corporation]] that looked so unusual that it was nicknamed \"Le Monstre\" by the French press. The smoothing of body shapes and fairing-in of various parts of the machine brought about by the continual search for reduction of [[aerodynamic drag]] led to a separation from [[Grand Prix motor racing|Grand Prix]] cars, which rarely had large bodywork.\n\nAs the years went on, bodywork became all enveloping, while at the same time lighter. The larger bodywork with spoilers were able to provide more downforce for the turns without increasing the [[Drag (physics)|drag]], allowing cars to maintain high speeds. Extended bodywork would usually concentrate on the rear of the car, usually being termed ''long tail''. The bodywork also began to cover the cockpit for less drag, although open cockpits would come and go over the years as rules varied. Aerodynamics reached its peak in 1989, before the Mulsanne Straight was modified. During the {{24hLM|1988}} race, the crew of a [[PRV engine|Peugeot]] powered [[Welter Racing|W.M.]] prototype taped over the engine openings, allowing [[Roger Dorchy]] to set a recorded speed of {{Convert|405|km/h|mph|0|abbr=on}} down the Mulsanne in a publicity stunt, although the car was almost undrivable elsewhere on the circuit and the engine was soon destroyed from a lack of cooling.{{citation needed|date=February 2015}} However, for the {{24hLM|1989}} event, the [[Sauber C9|Mercedes-Benz C9]] reached {{Convert|400|km/h|mph|0|abbr=on}} under qualifying conditions.<ref>http://www.mulsannescorner.com/maxspeed.html</ref>\n\n===Engines===\n[[Image:1929 Bentley front 34 left 2.jpg|thumb|left|An early [[supercharging|supercharged]] [[Bentley]]]]\nA wide variety of engines have competed at Le Mans, in attempts to not only achieve greater speed but also to have better [[Fuel economy in automobiles|fuel economy]], and spend less time in the pits. Engine sizes have also varied greatly, with the smallest engines being a mere 569 cc ([[Simca 5|Simca Cinq]]) and the largest upwards of 8,000 cc ([[SRT Viper]] GTS-R). [[Supercharging]] was an early innovation for increasing output, first being raced in {{24hLM|1929}}, while [[turbocharging]] would not appear until {{24hLM|1974}}.\n\nThe first car to enter without an engine run by pistons would be in {{24hLM|1963}}, when [[Rover (car)|Rover]] partnered with [[British Racing Motors]] to run a [[gas turbine]] with mixed success, repeating again in {{24hLM|1965}}. The American Howmet Corporation would attempt to run a turbine again in {{24hLM|1968}} with even less success. Although the engines offered great power, they were hot and fuel-inefficient.\n\nAnother non-piston engine that would appear would be a [[Wankel engine]], otherwise known as the rotary engine. Run entirely by [[Mazda]] since its introduction in 1970, the compact engine would also suffer from fuel economy problems like the turbine had, yet would see the success that the turbine lacked. After many years of development, Mazda finally succeeded in being the only winner of the race to not have a piston-powered engine, taking the {{24hLM|1991}} event with the [[Mazda 787B|787B]]. Rotary engines were banned by the ACO following Mazda's win.\n\nAlternative fuel sources would also play a part in more normal engine designs, with the first non-gasoline car appearing in {{24hLM|1949}}. The Delettrez Special would be powered by a [[diesel engine]], while a second diesel would appear in the form of the M.A.P. the following year. Although diesel would appear at other times over the race existence, it would not be until 2006 when a major manufacturer, Audi, would invest in diesels and finally succeed, with the [[Audi R10 TDI|R10 TDI]].\n\n[[Ethanol fuel]] appeared in 1980 in a modified [[Porsche 911]], leading to a class win. Alternative biological fuel sources returned again in {{24hLM|2004}} with Team Nasamax's DM139-[[Judd (engine)|Judd]].<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.mulsannescorner.com/nasamaxdm139.html | title = Mulsannescorner.com, \"2004 Nasamax DM139\" | accessdate = 6 August 2008| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20080915211057/http://www.mulsannescorner.com/nasamaxdm139.html| archivedate= 15 September 2008 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref> In 2008, [[biofuels]] (10% [[ethanol]] for petrol engines and [[biodiesel]] for diesel engines) were allowed.

But only electrical (i.e., batteries) energy storage was allowed, ruling out [[flywheel]]-based energy recovery.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.racecar-engineering.com/news/people/282760/le-mans-2009-2011-regulations-released.html |title=Le Mans 2009 – 2001 regulations released |date=19 November 2008 |publisher=Racecar engineering |accessdate=11 October 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081228132644/http://www.racecar-engineering.com/news/people/282760/le-mans-2009-2011-regulations-released.html |archivedate=28 December 2008 |df=dmy-all }}</ref> Cars with KERS were allowed to race in 2009 under specific classification rules. Since 2010, they were able to compete for points and the championship. In 2012 the first KERS-equipped car won; the [[Audi R18#R18 e-tron quattro|Audi R18 e-tron]] with a flywheel hybrid system by [[Williams Hybrid Power]] activated and drove the front wheels. This was only allowed in certain zones, after the car had accelerated to at least 120&nbsp;km/h, in order to cancel out the acceleration advantage that four-wheelers could gain out of corners. In the same year, Toyota also started with a hybrid car, the [[Toyota TS030 Hybrid|TS030 Hybrid]], which used KERS to power its rear wheels, meaning its usage was not restricted.\n\n===Brakes===\nWith increased speeds around the track, brakes become a key issue for teams attempting to safely bring their cars down to a slow enough speed to make the Mulsanne Corner turn. [[Disc brake]]s were first seen in 1953 when the [[Jaguar C-Type]] raced at Le Mans. In 1955 the [[Mercedes-Benz 300 SLR]] introduced the [[Air brake (aircraft)|air brake]] using a large opening hood on the rear of the car.\n\nIn the 1980s, [[anti-lock braking system]]s became standard on most [[Group C]] cars as a safety measure, making it less likely that cars lose control at high speeds. By the late 1990s, [[reinforced carbon-carbon]] brakes were adapted for better stopping power.\n\n==Successful marques and drivers==\n:''For a list of winning drivers, teams, and cars, see [[List of 24 Hours of Le Mans winners]].''\n[[Image:Tom Kristensen 2014-06-10 001.jpg|thumb|The most successful participant of all time at Le Mans, Danish driver [[Tom Kristensen (racing driver)|Tom Kristensen]], has nine wins (7 with [[Audi]]), the latest in 2013.]]\n[[File:Hall of fame Le Mans-winners 2013.JPG|thumb|Tom Kristensen in the Walk of fame [[Le Mans]]-Winners 2013]]\nOver the years, many manufacturers have managed to take the overall win, while even more have taken class wins.

Jaguar has seven wins, while [[Bentley]], [[Alfa Romeo]], and Ford all won four races in a row, with Bentley recording two additional victories in other years. [[Mazda]] has been the only Japanese car to win the race—in 1991, the only win by a [[Wankel engine|rotary]] engine—though nearly every major Japanese manufacturer has attempted it.\n\nThree drivers stand apart for their number of victories. Initially [[Jacky Ickx]] held the record at six, scoring victories between 1969 and {{24hLM|1982}}, earning him an honorary citizenship to the town of Le Mans. His frequent racing-partner, [[Derek Bell (racing driver)|Derek Bell]], trailing by a single win, with five. However, [[Denmark|Dane]] [[Tom Kristensen (racing driver)|Tom Kristensen]] has beaten this record with nine wins between {{24hLM|1997}} and 2013, including six in a row. Three-time winner [[Woolf Barnato]] ({{24hLM|1928}} to {{24hLM|1930}}) and American racing legend [[AJ Foyt|A. J. Foyt]] (1967) are the only drivers to have won every Le Mans in which they participated.\n\n[[Henri Pescarolo]] won the race four times, and holds the record for the most Le Mans appearances at 33. Japan's [[Yojiro Terada]] was active as a driver until 2008, and holds the record for the most Le Mans starts without an overall win. [[Graham Hill]] is the only driver to win the so-called ''[[Triple Crown of Motorsport]]'', winning the [[Indianapolis 500]] (1966), [[Monaco Grand Prix]] (1963, 1964, 1965, 1968, 1969), and the 24 Hours of Le Mans (1972).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.usgpindy.com/news/story.php?story_id=1417 |title=Points Race Stays Tight; Montoya Joins Elite Company With Victory |author=Dan Knutson |accessdate=3 December 2007 |date=3 June 2003 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071106023236/http://www.usgpindy.com/news/story.php?story_id=1417 |archivedate=6 November 2007 |deadurl=yes }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://intakeinfo.com/automotive/monaco-grand-prix-glitz-draws-rising-stars.html |title=Monaco Grand Prix Glitz Draws Rising Stars |author=Henri Boulanger |publisher=IntakeInfo.com |accessdate=5 December 2007 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071211040252/http://intakeinfo.com/automotive/monaco-grand-prix-glitz-draws-rising-stars.html |archivedate=11 December 2007 |deadurl=yes }}</ref>\n\n==Accidents==\n{{See also|List of 24 Hours of Le Mans fatal accidents}}\nLe Mans has seen a number of fatal accidents. The [[1955 Le Mans disaster|worst]] one was in [[1955 24 Hours of Le Mans|1955]], when more than 80 spectators and driver [[Pierre Levegh]] were killed. In the wake of the disaster, many races were cancelled, including the Grand Prix races in [[German Grand Prix|Germany]], [[Spanish Grand Prix|Spain]], and [[Swiss Grand Prix|Switzerland]] (the latter as a part of a blanket ban on motorsport round-track races that is maintained to this day).<ref>Swiss Traffic Law (German)</ref> The accident led to safety regulations in all motorsports for both driver and spectator protection.\n\nAlmost all decades in which Le Mans has been run have seen their fair share of horrific accidents, such as in [[1972 24 Hours of Le Mans|1972]] when Swede [[Joakim Bonnier]] was catapulted into a forest surrounding the circuit after hitting a privately entered Ferrari near the Indianapolis section; Bonnier was killed instantly. The 1980s was a decade where some of the race's worst-ever accidents occurred. Although there were now Armco barriers along the straight, there were still no chicanes on the Mulsanne Straight – the place where almost all of the worst accidents took place during that time. The prototypes, most of which were equipped with very powerful turbocharged engines in those days, were capable of doing 240-250+ mph (387–403&nbsp;km/h) before reaching the kink and would still be doing the same kind of speeds at the end of the 3.6 mile (6&nbsp;km straight) – and even through the kink, which was a flat-out bend for all the cars on the track. In {{24hLM|1981}}, Belgian [[Thierry Boutsen]] crashed horrifically on the Mulsanne Straight in his WM-Peugeot, killing a marshal, and in the same race Frenchman Jean-Louis Lafosse was killed also on the Mulsanne Straight when his Rondeau steered very suddenly to the right and slammed into the Armco barrier on the driver's side at extreme speeds. The [[1984 24 Hours of Le Mans|1984]] race saw British privateer John Sheldon crashing at more than 200&nbsp;mph (320&nbsp;km/h) at the Mulsanne Kink; his [[Aston Martin]] [[V8 engine|V8]] powered [[Nimrod NRA/C2B|Nimrod]] tore through the Armco barriers into the trees. The resulting explosion was so violent that the woods next to the track caught fire. Sheldon survived with severe burns, and a track marshal was killed while two others were severely injured. Sheldon's own teammate, American Drake Olson in the second Nimrod-Aston Martin who was following him down the straight, crashed heavily after running over Sheldon's bodywork; he went into severe shock but survived with minor injuries. The field was under the safety car for over an hour while the crash site was cleared and the destroyed Armco barriers were replaced.\n\nIn [[1985 24 Hours of Le Mans|1985]] a similar accident befell Briton Dudley Wood in a Porsche 962 during practice. The impact of the car against the Armco, considering Wood was doing more than 230&nbsp;mph (371&nbsp;km/h), was so hard that it cracked the engine block. Fortunately, Wood survived without injury. Also in 1985 John Nielsen flipped his Sauber-Mercedes while going over the Mulsanne hump at more than 220&nbsp;mph (355&nbsp;km/h). The car landed on its roof and was destroyed, but Nielsen escaped without injury. In {{24hLM|1986}}, [[Jo Gartner]] drove a Porsche 962C into the Mulsanne barriers and was killed instantly after the car rolled multiple times, vaulted some Armco barriers, and knocked down a telegraph pole. And in [[1987 24 Hours of Le Mans|1987]], American [[Price Cobb]] crashed a works Porsche 962C after slipping on oil during Wednesday practice. The fuel tank exploded and the car burned to the ground but Cobb escaped without injury.\n\nGartner's fatal accident remained the most recent death in the race until Allan Simonsen's crash in [[2013 24 Hours of Le Mans|2013]]. However, there was one fatality during a practice session in [[1997 24 Hours of Le Mans|1997]] ([[Sebastien Enjolras]]).<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.dailysportscar.com/?p=9717 |title=Mark Cole’s Le Mans 2013 |publisher=Dailysportscar.com |date=2013-07-15 |accessdate=2013-08-05}}</ref>\n\nIn [[1999 24 Hours of Le Mans|1999]] the [[Mercedes-Benz CLR]]s suffered from aerodynamic instability leading to airborne cars. After initially happening at the Le Mans test day, Mercedes claimed to have solved the problem, only to have it occur again at warmup. [[Mark Webber]] was the unlucky driver whose car flipped on both occasions. The final and most damaging accident occurred during the race itself when [[Peter Dumbreck]]'s CLR became airborne, flying over the safety fencing and landing in the woods several metres away. No drivers were badly hurt in any of the three accidents, but Mercedes-Benz withdrew its remaining entry and ended its entire sportscar programme.\n\nIn [[2011 24 Hours of Le Mans|2011]], two horrific accidents occurred to two of the three factory [[Audi]]s in the LMP1 class. Near the end of the first hour, the No. 3 car driven by [[Allan McNish]] collided with one of the Ferrari GT cars, resulting in McNish's car smashing into the tyre wall and being thrown into the air at the Dunlop chicanes, resulting in pieces of bodywork flying over and nearly hitting many photographers on the other side of the barrier. In the eleventh hour of the race, another accident occurred, this time to the No. 1 car driven by [[Mike Rockenfeller]], when he had contact with another Ferrari GT car. In the runup to Indianapolis corner, Rockenfeller's Audi was sent into the outside barrier at over {{convert|170|mph}}. Only the main cockpit safety cell of the car remained along with major damage being done to the barriers that needed to be repaired before the race was resumed. Audi had switched to a closed-cockpit car starting in 2011, a decision credited for the fact that neither driver was injured. The 2014 regulations required all cars to be closed-cockpit as a direct result of the 2011 accident. \n                                                                     \nIn [[2012 24 Hours of Le Mans|2012]], [[Anthony Davidson]], driving for the returning Toyota team in a [[Toyota TS030 Hybrid]], collided with a [[Ferrari 458 Italia|Ferrari 458 GT2]] of Piergiuseppe Perazzini, and became airborne before crashing into the tyre barrier of the Mulsanne Corner at high speed. The Ferrari also ended up in the barrier, flipping and coming to a halt on its roof.

This was given a limited cinema release, but is now available on DVD.\n\nThe race became the center of a major motion picture in 1971 when [[Steve McQueen]] released his simply titled ''[[Le Mans (film)|Le Mans]]'', starring McQueen as Michael Delaney, a driver in the 1970 event for the [[Gulf Oil|Gulf]] Porsche team. Likened to other motorsports films such as ''[[Grand Prix (1966 film)|Grand Prix]]'' for Formula One racing and ''[[Winning]]'' for the [[Indianapolis 500]], ''Le Mans'' is the best known film to center on sports car racing. It was filmed during the race using modified racing cars carrying cameras, as well as purchased [[Porsche 917]]s, [[Ferrari 512]]s and [[Lola T70]]s for action shots made after the race. The [[Porsche 908]] which served as a camera car in the race actually finished, yet was so far behind the winners due to lengthy reel changes during pit stops that it was not classified in the results.\n\n''[[Michel Valliant (film)|Michel Valliant]] ''was a 2003 French movie about a French comic book motorsports hero that featured events from the {{24hLM|2002}} race although it was not explicitly about Le Mans. Again using two camera cars to tape action during the race, the French film was not as widely accepted as ''Le Mans'' had been. The 1974 TV show ''[[The Goodies (TV series)|The Goodies]]'' featured an episode entitled \"[[The Race (Goodies episode)|The Race]]\" involving a comedic trio attempting to run Le Mans.\n\nA documentary film called ''[[Truth in 24]]'' narrated by [[Jason Statham]] was about the Audi team's effort to win a fifth straight title in 2008 in which Le Mans was prominently featured.\n\nA documentary film called ''The 24 Hour War'' directed by [[Adam Carolla]] and Nate Adams, starring AJ Baime, Henry Ford III, David Hobbs and [[Mario Andretti]], is about the Ford versus Ferrari rivalry at Le Mans and is one of the most famous battles in racing history.<ref name=\"IMDb\">{{cite web|title=The 24 Hour War (2016)|url=http://www.imdb.com/title/tt4875844/r|website=IMDb.com|accessdate=12 June 2017}}</ref> \n\n<!-- The second half of the third book in Patrick O'Connor's Black Tiger series, \"The Black Tiger at Le Mans\", published in 1958, has his heroes Woody and Worm racing the Black Tiger Mark II and winning the 24 hours of Le Mans race.-->\nThe race has also been used for several video games over the years, some of which have allowed players to compete for the full 24 hours.\n\n===Coverage===\n[[Motors TV]] covered the Le Mans 24 Hours in its entirety in 2006 and 2007, including coverage of the scrutineering, qualifying, driver parade, warmup, and race. In the United States, [[Fox Sports 1]] and [[Fox Sports 2]] oscillatively airs complete race coverage live either on-air or online through a combination of coverage from the French host broadcaster and its own pit reporting crew.\n\nIn 2008, [[Eurosport]] secured a multi-year deal to show the entire race, including the qualifying and the motorcycle race. Every hour of the 2008 race was broadcast in segments on the main channel and on [[Eurosport 2]], but in recent years, a couple of hours were missed due to scheduling clashes with other sporting events.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://tv.eurosport.co.uk/tvschedule.shtml |title=Eurosport |accessdate=11 October 2010| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20101013122840/http://tv.eurosport.co.uk/tvschedule.shtml| archivedate= 13 October 2010 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref> In addition, Eurosport provided live streaming on its website to subscribers.

Broadcast from the circuit for the full 24 hours, it allows fans to listen to radio commentary. Radio Le Mans is also broadcast through [[internet radio]] online and via satellite radio on [[Sirius XM Radio]].\n\n==Vintage racing==\n{{Main|Le Mans Legend}}\nSince 2001, the ACO has allowed the \"[[Le Mans Legend]]\" event to participate on the full Circuit de la Sarthe. These exhibition races involve classic cars that had previously run at Le Mans or are similar to ones that had. Each year, a particular era of cars may participate, with the featured era changing from year to year. Though most drivers in this event are amateurs, some noted professional drivers have appeared to race cars they had previously run, such as [[Stirling Moss]] and [[Derek Bell (racing driver)|Derek Bell]].\n\n{{Main|Le Mans Classic}}\nStarting in 2002, the \"[[Le Mans Classic]]\" has been held as a biennial event on the full {{convert|13|km|adj=on|abbr=on}} circuit in July. The races take place over a full 24-hour day/night cycle, with starts on set times allowing cars from the same era to compete at the same time. A team typically consists of a car in each class, and the team with the most points accumulated over five or six classes is declared the overall winner. The classes are based on the era in which the cars would have competed. The exact class requirements are re-evaluated for every event, since for each event, the age for the youngest entries is shifted by two years. In the first event, five classes ran more short races; later events have featured six classes running fewer but longer races. Drivers are required to have an FIA International Competition license. This event also includes a large Concours d'Elegance and auction.\n\n==See also==\n{{Wikipedia books|Endurance motor racing}}\n*[[24 Hours of Le Mans (motorcycle race)]]\n*[[24 Hours of LeMons]]\n*[[Endurance racing (motorsport)|Endurance racing]]\n*[[Le Mans 24 Hours video games]]\n*[[List of 24 Hours of Le Mans winners]]\n*[[List of 24 hours of Le Mans records]]\n*[[Triple Crown of Motorsport]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n==References==\n* {{fr icon}} Le Mans 1965 in Automobile Historique n°48 May 2005\n* {{fr icon}} 24 heures du Mans 1973 in Automobile Historique n°49 June/July 2005\n\n==External links==\n{{commons|24 Heures du Mans}}\n* [http://www.24h-lemans.com/en/ Le Mans official website]\n* [http://www.racingsportscars.com/photo_lemans.html Racing Sports Cars] – historical photos and results\n* [http://www.lemans-history.com Le Mans History] – The History of Le Mans 24 Hours race\n* [http://www.les24heures.fr 24h of Le Mans History and database]\n\n{{24 Hours of Le Mans}}\n{{Automobile endurance races}}\n{{Coord|47|56|30|N|0|13|30|E|region:FR-72_type:landmark|display=title}}\n{{Use dmy dates|date=April 2013}}\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:24 Hours Of Le Mans}}\n[[Category:24 Hours of Le Mans| ]]\n[[Category:Sarthe]]\n[[Category:Recurring events established in 1923]]\n[[Category:Group C]]\n[[Category:World Sportscar Championship races|Le Mans]]\n[[Category:Tourist attractions in Sarthe]]"
