This varying nomenclature reflects the fact that contemporaries – as well as later historians – viewed the general conflict from particular national or dynastic viewpoints.</ref> was a conflict between [[Louis XIV of France]] and a European coalition of the Holy Roman Empire (led by Austria), the Dutch Republic, Spain, England and Savoy.  It was fought in Europe and the surrounding seas, North America and in India. It is sometimes considered the first [[global war]]. The conflict encompassed the [[Williamite war in Ireland]] and [[Jacobite risings]] in Scotland, where [[William III of England|William III]] and [[James II of England|James II]] struggled for control of England and Ireland, and a campaign in colonial North America between French and English settlers and their respective Indigenous allies, today called '''[[King William's War]]''' by Americans.\n\n[[Louis XIV of France]] had emerged from the [[Franco-Dutch War]] in 1678 as the most powerful monarch in Europe, an [[Absolute monarchy|absolute]] ruler who had won numerous military victories. Using a combination of aggression, annexation, and quasi-legal means, Louis XIV set about extending his gains to stabilize and strengthen France's frontiers, culminating in the brief [[War of the Reunions]] (1683–84). The [[Truce of Ratisbon]] guaranteed France's new borders for twenty years, but Louis XIV's subsequent actions—notably his [[Edict of Fontainebleau]] (the revocation of the Edict of Nantes) in 1685— led to the deterioration of his military and political dominance. Louis XIV's decision to cross the [[Rhine]] in September 1688 was designed to extend his influence and pressure the [[Holy Roman Empire]] into accepting his territorial and dynastic claims. Leopold I and the German princes resolved to resist, and when the [[States General of the Netherlands|States General]] and William III brought the Dutch and the English into the war against France, the French king faced a powerful coalition aimed at curtailing his ambitions.\n\nThe main fighting took place around France's borders in the [[Spanish Netherlands]], the [[Rhineland]], the [[Duchy of Savoy]] and [[Catalonia]]. The fighting generally favoured Louis XIV's armies, but by 1696 his country was in the grip of an economic crisis. The Maritime Powers (England and the Dutch Republic) were also financially exhausted, and when Savoy defected from the Alliance, all parties were keen to negotiate a settlement. By the terms of the [[Treaty of Ryswick]] (1697) Louis XIV retained the whole of [[Alsace]] but was forced to return [[Lorraine (duchy)|Lorraine]] to its ruler and give up any gains on the right bank of the Rhine. Louis XIV also accepted William III as the rightful King of England, while the Dutch acquired a Barrier fortress system in the Spanish Netherlands to help secure their borders. With the ailing and childless [[Charles II of Spain]] approaching his end, a new conflict over the inheritance of the [[Spanish Empire]] embroiled Louis XIV and the Grand Alliance in the [[War of the Spanish Succession]].\n\n==Background 1678–87==\nIn the years following the [[Franco-Dutch War]] (1672–78) [[Louis XIV of France|Louis XIV]] of France – now at the height of his powers – sought to impose religious unity in France, and to solidify and expand his frontiers. Louis XIV had already won his personal glory by conquering new territory, but he was no longer willing to pursue an open-ended militarist policy of the kind he had undertaken in 1672, and instead relied upon France's clear military superiority to achieve specific strategic objectives along his borders. Proclaimed the 'Sun King', a more mature Louis – conscious he had failed to achieve decisive results against the Dutch – had turned from conquest to security, using threats rather than open war to intimidate his neighbours into submission.<ref>McKay; Scott, p. 36.</ref>\n\nLouis XIV, along with his chief advisor [[François-Michel le Tellier, Marquis de Louvois|Louvois]], his foreign minister [[Charles Colbert, marquis de Croissy|Colbert de Croissy]], and his technical expert, [[Sébastien Le Prestre de Vauban|Vauban]], developed France's defensive strategy.<ref name=lynn37>Lynn, p. 37.</ref> Vauban had advocated a system of impregnable fortresses along the frontier that would keep France's enemies out. To construct a proper system, however, the King needed to acquire more land from his neighbours to form a solid forward line. This rationalisation of the frontier would make it far more defensible while defining it more clearly in a political sense, yet it also created the paradox that while Louis's ultimate goals were defensive, he pursued them by hostile means.<ref name=lynn37/> The King grabbed the necessary territory through what is known as the ''[[War of the Reunions|Réunions]]'': a strategy that combined legalism, arrogance, and aggression.<ref name=lynn161>Lynn, p. 161.</ref>\n\n===Reunions===\n[[File:René-Antoine Houasse - Retrato equestre de Luís XIV, Rei de França.jpg|thumb|upright|Equestrian Portrait of Louis XIV (1638–1715) by [[René-Antoine Houasse]]. The 'Sun King' was the most powerful monarch in Europe.]]\n\nThe [[Treaties of Nijmegen|Treaty of Nijmegen]] (1678) and the earlier [[Peace of Westphalia|Treaty of Westphalia]] (1648) provided Louis XIV with the justification for the Reunions. These treaties had awarded France territorial gains, but because of the vagaries of the language (as with most treaties of the period) they were notoriously imprecise and self-contradictory, and never specified exact boundary lines. This imprecision often led to differing interpretations of the text resulting in long-standing disputes over the frontier zones – one gained a town or area and its 'dependencies', but it was often unclear what these dependencies were.<ref name=lynn37/> The machinery needed to determine these territorial ambiguities was already in place through the medium of the [[Parlement]]s at [[Metz]] (technically the only '[[Chambers of Reunion|Chamber of Reunion]]'), [[Parlement of Besançon|Besançon]], and a superior court at [[Breisach]], dealing respectively with [[Lorraine (duchy)|Lorraine]], [[Franche-Comté]], and [[Alsace]].<ref>Wolf (1970), p. 499. Although not technically belonging to France, Louis XIV had integrated Lorraine into his kingdom after occupying it in 1670.</ref> Unsurprisingly, these courts usually found in Louis XIV's favour.<ref>Doyle: ''Short Oxford History of France – Old Regime France,'' 182</ref> By 1680 the disputed [[County of Montbéliard]] (lying between Franche-Comté and Alsace) had been separated from the [[History of Württemberg|Duchy of Württemberg]], and by August, Louis XIV had secured the whole of Alsace with the exception of [[Strasbourg]]. The Chamber of Reunion of Metz soon laid claims to land around the [[Three Bishoprics]] of Metz, Toul, and Verdun, and most of the Spanish [[Duchy of Luxembourg]]. The fortress of [[Luxembourg (city)|Luxembourg]] itself was subsequently blockaded with the intention of it becoming part of Louis XIV's defensible frontier.<ref name=\"childs11\">Childs (1991), p. 11.</ref>\n\n[[File:Holy Roman Emperor Leopold I.png|thumb|upright|left|Holy Roman Emperor Leopold I (1640–1705), artist unknown]]\n\nOn 30 September 1681, French troops also seized Strasbourg and its outpost, [[Kehl]], on the right bank of the [[Rhine]], a bridge which Holy Roman Empire (\"Imperial\") troops had regularly exploited during the latter stages of the Dutch War.<ref>Lynn, p. 163.</ref> By forcibly taking the Imperial city the French now controlled two of the three bridgeheads over the Rhine (the others being Breisach, which was already in French hands, and [[Philippsburg]], which Louis XIV had lost by the Treaty of Nijmegen). On the same day that Strasbourg fell French forces marched into [[Casale Monferrato|Casale]] in northern Italy.<ref>Lynn, p. 164.</ref> The fortress was not taken through the process of the Reunions but had earlier been purchased from the [[Ferdinand Charles, Duke of Mantua and Montferrat|Duke of Mantua]], which, together with the French possession of [[Pinerolo]], enabled France to tie down Victor Amadeus II, the [[Victor Amadeus II of Sardinia|Duke of Savoy]], and threaten the Spanish [[Duchy of Milan]] (''see map below'').<ref>Piedmont was now hemmed in by two massive French-occupied fortresses: Casale on the eastern flank, and, on its western edge, Pinerolo, annexed by France fifty years earlier in defiance of the 1631 [[Treaty of Cherasco]].</ref> All Reunion claims and annexations were important strategic points of entry and exit between France and its neighbours, and all were immediately fortified by Vauban and incorporated into his fortress system.<ref>McKay; Scott, p. 37.</ref>\n\nThus, the Reunions were carving territory from the frontiers of future Germany, while annexations were establishing French power in Italy. Yet by seeking to construct his impregnable border, Louis XIV so alarmed the other European states that he made the war he sought to avoid inevitable: his fortresses not only covered his frontiers, they projected French power.<ref>Lynn, p. 38.</ref> Only two statesmen might hope to oppose Louis XIV: William of Orange, [[Stadtholder]] of the United Provinces of the Dutch Republic and the natural leader of Protestant opposition; and Holy Roman Emperor [[Leopold I, Holy Roman Emperor|Leopold I]], obvious leader of anti-French forces in the Holy Roman Empire and [[Roman Catholic Church|Catholic]] Europe.<ref>Wolf (1962), p. 19.</ref> But while William and Leopold I wanted to act, effective opposition in 1681–82 was out of the question: [[History of Amsterdam#The \"Golden Age\" (1585-1672)|Amsterdam]]'s [[Vroedschap|burghers]] wanted no further conflict with France; moreover, Leopold I and William were fully aware of the current weaknesses, not only of Spain, but also the Empire, whose important German princes from [[Archbishopric of Mainz|Mainz]], [[Archbishopric of Trier|Trier]], [[Electorate of Cologne|Cologne]], [[Electorate of Saxony|Saxony]], [[Bavaria]] and, significantly, [[Frederick William I, Elector of Brandenburg|Frederick William I of Brandenburg]], remained in French pay.<ref name=\"mckayscott38\">McKay; Scott: p. 38. Frederick William would not move against France. With French aid he hoped to conquer [[Pomerania]].</ref>\n\n===Fighting on two fronts===\n{{Main article|Great Turkish War|War of the Reunions}}\nSince Leopold I's intervention in the Franco-Dutch War Louis XIV had considered the Emperor his most dangerous enemy; yet the French king had little reason to fear him.<ref name=mckayscott38/> Leopold I was weak, and was in grave danger along his [[Royal Hungary|Hungarian]] borders where the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman Turks]] were threatening to overrun all central Europe from the south. Louis had encouraged and assisted the Ottoman drive against Leopold I's [[House of Habsburg|Habsburg]] lands, and had assured the [[Ottoman Porte|Porte]] that he would not support the Emperor. He had also urged [[John III Sobieski|Jan Sobieski]] of Poland (unsuccessfully) not to side with Leopold I, and pressed the malcontent princes of [[Principality of Transylvania (1571–1711)|Transylvania]] and Hungary to join with the Sultan's forces and free their territory from Habsburg rule.<ref>Wolf (1962), p. 20.</ref> When the Turks besieged [[Vienna]] in the [[Battle of Vienna|spring of 1683]] Louis did nothing to help the defenders.<ref>Wolf (1962), p. 18. To [[John Baptist Wolf]], Louis's determination to break the power of Leopold I was a sign that the French King's ultimate aim was European hegemony. With the Austrian Habsburgs defeated France would be the only power capable of driving the Turks from Germany whose princes, perhaps, would reward Louis XIV by electing him, or one of his progeny, to be the Holy Roman Emperor. To the historian [[John A. Lynn|John Lynn]] this is a compelling argument but not absolutely conclusive: distracting the Austrians by encouraging the Turks was an old French stratagem, and does not in itself prove Louis XIV's lust for universal monarchy.</ref>\n\nTaking advantage of the Ottoman threat in the east Louis XIV invaded the [[Southern Netherlands|Spanish Netherlands]] on 1 September 1683 and renewed the siege of Luxembourg, which had been abandoned the previous year.<ref>With the growing Ottoman threat in the east, Louis XIV, the Most Christian King, had deemed it impolitic, cynically to some, for him to continue the assault in 1682, which could be seen as aiding the infidel.</ref> The French required of the Emperor and [[Charles II of Spain]] a recognition of the legality of the recent Reunions, but the Spanish were unwilling to see any more of their holdings fall under Louis's jurisdiction.<ref>Wolf (1970), p. 513.</ref> Spain's military options were highly limited, yet the Ottoman [[Battle of Vienna|defeat before Vienna]] on 12 September had emboldened them. In the hope that Leopold I would now make peace in the east and come to their assistance, Charles II declared war on France on 26 October. However, the Emperor had decided to continue the Turkish war in the Balkans and, for the time being, compromise in the west. With Leopold I unwilling to fight on two fronts; with a strong neutralist party in the Dutch Republic tying William's hands; and with the Elector of Brandenburg stubbornly holding to his alliance with Louis, there was no possible outcome but complete French victory.<ref>Wolf (1962), p. 24.</ref>\n\nThe [[War of the Reunions]] was brief and devastating. With the fall of [[Kortrijk|Courtrai]] in early November 1683, followed by [[Diksmuide|Dixmude]] in December and Luxembourg in June 1684, Charles II was compelled to accept Louis XIV's peace deal.<ref>Lynn, p. 167–69.</ref> The [[Truce of Ratisbon]] (Regensburg) signed on 15 August by France on one side and the Emperor and Spain on the other, rewarded the French with Strasbourg, Luxembourg and the Reunion gains (Courtrai and Dixmude returned to Spain). The resolution was not a definitive peace, but only a truce for 20 years. Yet Louis had sound reasons to feel satisfied: the Emperor and German princes were fully occupied in Hungary—while in the Dutch Republic, William of Orange remained isolated and powerless, largely because of the pro-French mood in Amsterdam.<ref>McKay; Scott, p. 39.</ref>\n\n===Persecution of the Huguenots===\n[[File:King William III of England, (1650-1702).jpg|thumb|upright|William of Orange (1650–1702), portrayed here as King William III of England by Sir [[Godfrey Kneller]].]]\n\nAt Ratisbon in 1684 France had been in a position to impose its will on Europe; however, after 1685 its dominant military and diplomatic position began to deteriorate. One of the main factors for this diminution was Louis XIV's revocation of the [[Edict of Nantes]] and the subsequent dispersal of France's [[Protestantism|Protestant]] community.<ref name = wolf35>Wolf (1962), p. 35.</ref> As many as 200,000 [[Huguenot]]s fled to England, the Dutch Republic, Switzerland, and Germany, spreading tales of [[Dragonnade|brutality]] at the hands of the monarch of [[Palace of Versailles|Versailles]]. The direct effect on France of the loss of this community is debatable, but the flight helped destroy the pro-French group in the Dutch Republic, not only because of their Protestant affiliations, but with the exodus of Huguenot merchants and the harassment of Dutch merchants living in France, it also greatly affected Franco-Dutch trade.<ref name=\"wolf36\">Wolf (1962), p. 36.</ref> The persecution had another effect on Dutch public opinion – the conduct of the Catholic King of France made them look more anxiously at [[James II of England|James II]], now the Catholic King of England. Many in [[The Hague]] believed James II was closer to his cousin Louis XIV than to his son-in-law and nephew William, thus engendering suspicion, and in turn hostility, between the two states.<ref>Miller: ''James II,'' 144. James II's mother [[Henrietta Maria]] was the sister of Louis XIV's father [[Louis XIII]]; William's mother, [[Mary, Princess Royal and Princess of Orange|Mary, Princess Royal]], was James II's sister.</ref> Louis's seemingly endless territorial claims, coupled with his Protestant persecution, enabled William of Orange and his party to gain the ascendancy in the Republic and finally lay the groundwork for his long-sought alliance against France.<ref name=mckay40>McKay; Scott, p. 40.</ref>\n\n[[File:Kurfürst Friedrich Wilhelm von Brandenburg 4.jpeg|thumb|left|upright|Frederick William, Elector of Brandenburg (1620–88). He was succeeded by his son, [[Frederick I of Prussia|Frederick]], who proved to be one of William of Orange's most loyal allies.]]\n\nAlthough James II had permitted the Huguenots to settle in England, he had enjoyed an amicable relationship with his co-religionist Louis XIV, realising the importance of the friendship for his own Catholicising measures at home against the suspicions of his Protestant majority.<ref>Miller: ''James II,'' 145</ref> But the Huguenot presence gave an immense boost to anti-French discourse, and they joined forces with elements in England already highly suspicious of James.<ref>Simms: ''Three Victories and a Defeat: The Rise and Fall of the First British Empire,'' 34.</ref> However, conflicts between French and English commercial interests in North America had caused severe friction between the two governments: the French had grown antagonistic towards the [[Hudson's Bay Company]] and the [[New England]] colonies, while the English looked upon French pretensions in [[New France]] as encroaching upon their own possessions. This rivalry had spread to the other side of the world where [[East India Company|English]] and [[French East India Company|French]] East India companies had already embarked upon hostilities.<ref>Wolf (1962), p. 38.</ref>\n\nMany in Germany reacted negatively to the persecution of the Huguenots, disabusing the Protestant princes of the idea that Louis XIV was their ally against the intolerant practices of the Catholic Habsburgs.<ref>Childs (1991), p. 13.</ref> The [[Frederick William, Elector of Brandenburg|Elector of Brandenburg]] answered the revocation of the Edict of Nantes by promulgating the [[Edict of Potsdam]], and invited the fleeing Huguenots to [[Brandenburg-Prussia|Brandenburg]]. But there were motivations other than religious adherence that disabused him (and other German Princes) of his allegiance to France. Louis XIV had pretensions in the [[Electoral Palatinate|Palatinate]] in the name of his sister-in-law, [[Elizabeth Charlotte of the Palatinate|Elizabeth Charlotte]], threatening further annexations of the Rhineland.<ref>Wolf (1970), p. 530.</ref> Thus Frederick-William, spurning his French subsidies, ended his alliance with France and reached agreements with William of Orange, the Emperor, and, temporarily putting aside his differences over [[Pomerania]], with King [[Charles XI of Sweden]].<ref name = wolf36/>\n\nThe consequences of the flight of the Huguenots in southern France brought outright war in the [[Alps|Alpine]] districts of [[Piedmont]] in the [[Duchy of Savoy]] (a northern Italian state nominally part of the Empire). From their fort at Pinerolo the French were able to exert considerable pressure on the Duke of Savoy and force him to persecute his own Protestant community, the [[Waldensians|Vaudois]] (Valdesi). This constant threat of interference and intrusion into his domestic affairs was a source of concern for Victor Amadeus, and from 1687 the Duke's policy became increasingly anti-French as he searched for a chance to assert his aspirations and concerns. This criticism for Louis XIV's regime was spreading all over Europe.<ref>Wolf (1970), p. 520</ref> The Truce of Ratisbon, followed by the revocation of the Edict of Nantes, was a cause of suspicion as to Louis's true intentions; many were also fearful of the King's supposed designs on universal monarchy – the uniting of the Spanish and German crowns with that of France. In response, representatives from the Emperor, the south German princes, Spain (motivated by the French attack in 1683 and the imposed truce of 1684), and Sweden (in their capacity as princes within the Empire) met in [[Augsburg]] to form a defensive league of the Rhine in July 1686.

He also proposed to occupy the territories that he believed belonged to his sister-in-law regarding the Palatinate succession. The Emperor and the German princes, the Pope, and William of Orange were quite unwilling to grant these demands. For the Dutch in particular, Louis's control of Cologne and Liège would be strategically unacceptable, for with these territories in French hands the Spanish Netherlands 'buffer-zone' would be effectively bypassed. The day after Louis issued his manifesto – well before his enemies could have known its details – the main French army crossed the Rhine as a prelude to [[Siege of Philippsburg (1688)|investing Philippsburg]], the key post between Luxembourg (annexed in 1684) and Strasbourg (seized in 1681), and other Rhineland towns.<ref>Lynn, pp. 192–193.</ref> This pre-emptive strike was intended to intimidate the German states into accepting his conditions, while encouraging the Ottoman Turks to continue their own struggle with the Emperor in the east.<ref>McKay; Scott, p. 42.</ref>\n\nLouis XIV and his ministers had hoped for a quick resolution similar to that secured from the War of the Reunions, but by 1688 the situation was drastically different.

The French King supported James for two reasons: first, Louis XIV fervently believed in his God-ordained right to the throne; and second, he wished to divert William III's forces away from the Low Countries.<ref name=\"Lynn, p. 203\">Lynn, p. 203.</ref> James II's initial aim, and that of his deputy the [[Richard Talbot, 1st Earl of Tyrconnell|Duke of Tyrconnell]], was to pacify the northern Protestant strongholds. However, his ill-equipped army of around 40,000 could do little more than [[Siege of Derry|besiege Derry]]. Derry mounted a determined defence that lasted 105 days, and the city was finally relieved by the [[Royal Navy]] at the end of July.

After Ginkell's victory over the [[Marquis de St Ruth|Marquis of Saint-Ruth]] at the [[Battle of Aughrim]] on 12 July (O.S.), the remaining Jacobite strongholds fell in rapid succession. Without prospect of further French assistance the [[Siege of Limerick (1691)|capitulation at Limerick]] finally sealed victory for William III and his supporters in Ireland with the signing of the [[Treaty of Limerick]] on 3 October (O.S.).

On 12 May 1689 the Dutch and the Holy Roman Emperor had signed an offensive compact in Vienna, the aims of which were no less than to force France back to her borders as they were at the end of the [[Franco-Spanish War (1635)|Franco-Spanish War]] (1659), thus depriving Louis XIV of all his gains since his assumption of power.<ref name=\"wolf43\">Wolf (1962), p. 43.</ref> This meant for the Emperor and the German princes the reconquest of Lorraine, Strasbourg, parts of Alsace, and some Rhineland fortresses. Leopold I had tried to disentangle himself from the Turkish war to concentrate on the coming struggle, but the French invasion of the Rhineland had encouraged the Turks to stiffen their terms for peace and make demands the Emperor could not conceivably accept.<ref name=spielman147>Spielman: ''Leopold I of Austria,'' p. 147.</ref> Leopold I's decision to side with the coalition (against the opposition of many of his advisers) was, therefore, a decision to intervene in the west while continuing to fight the Ottomans in the Balkans. Although the Emperor's immediate concerns were for the Rhineland, the most important parts of the treaty were the secret articles pledging England and the States-General to assist him in securing the Spanish succession should Charles II die without an heir, and to use their influence to secure [[Joseph I, Holy Roman Emperor|his son's]] election to succeed him as Emperor.\n\n[[File:Sebastien le Prestre de Vauban.png|thumb|left|upright|Marshal Vauban (1633–1707), Louis XIV's greatest military engineer and one of his most trusted advisers]]\n\nWilliam III regarded the war as an opportunity to reduce the power of France and protect the Dutch Republic, while providing conditions that would encourage trade and commerce.<ref name=childs27>Childs (1991), p. 27</ref> Although there remained territorial anomalies, Dutch war aims did not involve substantial alterations to the frontier; but William did aim to secure his new position in Britain. By seeking refuge in France and subsequently invading Ireland, James II had given William III the ideal instrument to convince the English parliament that entry into a major European war was unavoidable. With the support of Parliament, William III and Mary II declared war on 17 May 1689 (O.S.); they then passed the [[Trade with France Act 1688]] (1 Will. & Mar. c. 34), which prohibited all English trade and commerce with France, effective 24 August 1689.<ref>[http://www.british-history.ac.uk/statutes-realm/vol6/pp98-103 ''An Act for Prohibiting all Trade and Commerce with France.'']</ref> This Anglo-Dutch alignment was the basis for the [[Grand Alliance (League of Augsburg)|Grand Alliance]], ratified on 20 December by William III representing England, [[Anthonie Heinsius]] and Treasurer [[Jacob Hop]] representing the Dutch Republic, and [[Leopold Wilhelm, Count von Königsegg|Königsegg]] and [[Theodor Heinrich Stratman|Stratman]] representing Emperor Leopold I. Like the Dutch the English were not preoccupied with territorial gains on the Continent, but were deeply concerned with limiting the power of France to defend against a Jacobite restoration (Louis XIV threatened to overthrow the Glorious Revolution and the precarious political settlement by supporting the old king over the new one).<ref>Childs (1991), p. 25.</ref> William III had secured his goal of mobilising Britain's resources for the anti-French coalition, but the Jacobite threat in Scotland and Ireland meant only a small English expeditionary force could be committed to assist the [[Dutch States Army]] in the coalition in the Spanish Netherlands for the first three years of the war.\n\nThe Duke of Lorraine also joined the Alliance at the same time as England, while the King of Spain (who had been at war with France since April 1689) and the Duke of Savoy signed in June 1690.

The importance of the Spanish Netherlands was the result of its geographic position, sandwiched between France and the Dutch Republic. Initially [[Louis de Crevant, Duke of Humières|Marshal Humières]] commanded French forces in this theatre but in 1689, while the French concentrated on the Rhine, it produced little more than a stand-off – the most significant engagement occurred when William's second-in-command, the [[Prince Georg Friedrich of Waldeck|Prince of Waldeck]], defeated Humières in a skirmish at the [[Battle of Walcourt]] on 25 August. However, by 1690 the Spanish Netherlands had become the main seat of the war where the French formed two armies: Boufflers' army on the [[Moselle (river)|Moselle]], and a larger force to the west under Humières' successor – and Louis XIV's greatest general of the period – [[François-Henri de Montmorency, duc de Luxembourg|Marshal Luxembourg]]. On 1 July Luxembourg secured a clear tactical victory over Waldeck at the [[Battle of Fleurus (1690)|Battle of Fleurus]]; but his success produced little benefit – Louis XIV's concerns for the dauphin on the Rhine (where [[Guy Aldonce de Durfort de Lorges|Marshal de Lorge]] now held actual command) overrode strategic necessity in the other theatres and forestalled a plan to besiege Namur or Charleroi.<ref name=\"rowlands\" /> For the Emperor and the German princes, though, the most serious fact of 1690 was that the Turks had been victorious on the Danube, requiring them to send reinforcements to the east. The Elector of Bavaria – now Imperial commander-in-chief following Lorraine's death in April – could offer nothing on the lower or upper Rhine, and the campaign failed to produce a single major battle or siege.<ref>Spielman: ''Leopold I of Austria,'' p. 149.</ref>\n\n[[File:Batalla de Fleurus (1690).jpg|thumb|250px|[[Battle of Fleurus (1690)|Battle of Fleurus]], 1690]]\n\nThe smallest front of the war was in Catalonia.

Exploiting the situation, Noailles captured [[Camprodon]] on 22 May, but a larger Spanish army under the [[Carlos de Gurrea, 9th Duke of Villahermosa|Duke of Villahermosa]] forced him to withdraw back to [[Roussillon]] in August.<ref>Childs (2003), p. 187.</ref> The Catalan campaign settled down in 1690, but a new front in Piedmont-Savoy proved more eventful.

Catinat immediately took [[Saluzzo]], followed by [[Savigliano]], [[Fossano]], and [[Susa (Italy)|Susa]], but lacking sufficient troops, and with sickness rife within his army, Catinat was obliged to withdraw back across the [[Alps]] for the winter.<ref>Lynn, p. 213.</ref>\n\n[[File:Siege of Mons 1691.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Siege of Mons 1691.

With the hope of unhinging the coalition French commanders in 1691 prepared for an early double-blow: the [[Siege of Mons (1691)|capture of Mons]] in the Spanish Netherlands, and [[Nice]] in northern Italy. Boufflers invested Mons on 15 March with some 46,000 men, while Luxembourg commanded a similar force of observation.

In contrast, the northern Italian theatre was very active.

Meanwhile, to the north, in the Duchy of Savoy, the Marquis of La Hoguette took Montmélian (the region's last remaining stronghold) on 22 December – a major loss for the Grand Alliance. However, by comparison the French campaign on the Piedmontese plain was far from successful. Although [[Carmagnola]] fell in June, the [[Antoine de Pas de Feuquières|Marquis of Feuquières]], on learning of the approach of [[Prince Eugene of Savoy]]'s relief force, precipitously abandoned the [[Siege of Cuneo (1691)|Siege of Cuneo]] with the loss of some 800 men and all his heavy guns. With Louis XIV concentrating his resources in Alsace and the Low Countries, Catinat was forced onto the defensive. The initiative in northern Italy now passed to the Allies who, as early as August, had 45,000 men (on paper) in the region, enabling them to regain Carmagnola in October. Louis XIV offered peace terms in December, but anticipating military superiority for the following campaign Amadeus was not prepared to negotiate seriously.<ref name=rowlands/>\n\n===Heavy fighting: 1692–93===\nAfter the sudden death of the influential Louvois in July 1691 Louis XIV had assumed a more active role in the direction of military policy, relying on advice from experts such as the [[Jules Louis Bolé, marquis de Chamlay|Marquis of Chamlay]] and Vauban.<ref>Wolf (1970), p. 568.</ref> Louvois' death also brought changes to state policy with the less adventurous [[Paul de Beauvilliers, 2nd duc de Saint-Aignan|Duke of Beauvilliers]] and the [[Simon Arnauld, marquis de Pomponne|Marquis of Pomponne]] entering Louis XIV's government as ministers of state. From 1691 onwards Louis XIV and Pomponne pursued efforts to unglue the Grand Alliance, including secret talks with Emperor Leopold I and, from August, attempts of religious solidarity with Catholic Spain. The approaches made to Spain came to naught (the Nine Years' War was not a [[religious war]]), but the Maritime Powers were also keen for peace. Talks were hampered, however, by Louis XIV's reluctance to cede his earlier gains (at least those made in the Reunions) and, in his deference to the principle of the divine right of kings, his unwillingness to recognise William III's claim to the English throne. For his part William III was intensely suspicious of Louis XIV and his supposed designs for universal monarchy.<ref name=\"mckay50\">McKay; Scott, p. 50.</ref>\n\nOver the winter of 1691–92 the French devised a grand plan to gain the ascendancy over their enemies – a design for the invasion of England in one more effort to support James II in his attempts to regain his kingdoms; and a simultaneous assault on [[Namur (city)|Namur]] in the Spanish Netherlands. The French hoped that Namur's seizure might inspire the Dutch to make peace, but if not, its capture would nevertheless be an important pawn at any future negotiations.<ref name=wolf573>Wolf (1970), p. 573.</ref> With 60,000 men (protected by a similar force of observation under Luxembourg), Marshal Vauban [[Siege of Namur (1692)|invested the stronghold]] on 29 May. The town soon fell but the citadel – defended by van Coehoorn – held out until 30 June. Endeavouring to restore the situation in the Spanish Netherlands William III surprised Luxembourg's army near the village of [[Battle of Steenkerque|Steenkirk]] on 3 August. The Allies enjoyed some initial success, but as French reinforcements came up William III's advance stalled. The Allies retired from the field in good order, and both sides claimed victory: the French because they repulsed the assault; the Allies because they had saved Liège from the same fate as Namur. However, due to the nature of late 17th-century warfare the battle, like Fleurus before it, produced little of consequence.<ref name=lynn227>Lynn, p. 227.</ref> ([[Nine Years' War#Weapons, technology, and the art of war|See below]]).\n\n[[File:The Battle of La Hogue, 23 May 1692.png|thumb|left|250px|[[Battles of Barfleur and La Hogue|Battle of La Hogue]], (1692) by [[Adriaen van Diest]].

James II believed that there would be considerable support for his cause once he had established himself on English soil, but a series of delays and conflicting orders ensured a very uneven naval contest in the English Channel.<ref name=wolf573/> The [[Battles of Barfleur and La Hogue|engagement]] was fought at the tip of the [[Cherbourg-Octeville|Cherbourg peninsula]], and lasted six days. At the action off Cape Barfleur on 29 May, the French fleet of 44 rated vessels under Admiral Tourville put up stern resistance against Admirals [[George Rooke|Rooke]]'s and [[Edward Russell, 1st Earl of Orford|Russell]]'s 82 rated English and Dutch vessels.<ref>Aubrey: ''The Defeat of James Stuart's Armada 1692,'' 175–79.

Yet the battle itself was not the death-blow for the French navy: the subsequent mismanagement and underfunding of the fleet under [[Louis Phélypeaux, comte de Pontchartrain|Pontchartrain]], coupled with Louis XIV's own personal lack of interest, were central to the French losing naval superiority over the English and Dutch during the Nine Years' War.<ref>Wolf (1970), pp. 574–75.</ref>\n\nMeanwhile, in southern Europe the Duke of Savoy with 29,000 men (substantially exceeding Catinat's number who had sent some troops to the Netherlands) invaded Dauphiné via the mountain trails shown to them by the Vaudois. The Allies invested [[Embrun, Hautes-Alpes|Embrun]], which capitulated on 15 August, before sacking the deserted town of [[Gap, Hautes-Alpes|Gap]].<ref name=\"Clark245\">Clark, p. 245.</ref> However, with their commander falling ill with smallpox, and concluding that holding Embrun was untenable, the Allies abandoned Dauphiné in mid-September, leaving behind seventy villages and châteaux burned and pillaged.<ref>Lynn, p. 228.</ref> The attack on Dauphiné had required Noailles give up troops to bolster Catinat, condemning him to a passive campaign in Catalonia; but on the Rhine the French gained the upper hand.

In the event, Heidelberg fell on 22 May before Luxembourg's army took to the field in the Netherlands, but the new Imperial commander on the Rhine, [[Louis William, Margrave of Baden-Baden|Prince Louis of Baden]], provided a strong defence and prevented further French gains. Luxembourg had better luck in the Low Countries, however. After taking [[Huy]] on 23 July, the French commander outmanoeuvred William III, catching him off-guard between the villages of Neerwinden and Landen. The [[Battle of Landen|ensuing engagement]] on 29 July was a close and costly encounter but French forces, whose cavalry once again showed their superiority, prevailed.<ref>Chandler, p. 53.</ref> Luxembourg and Vauban proceeded to take Charleroi on 10 October which, together with the earlier prizes of Mons, Namur and Huy, provided the French with a new and impressive forward line of defence.<ref>Lynn, p. 236</ref>\n\n[[File:Catalonian campaign, 1689-97.png|thumb|250px|Catalan campaign 1689–97.

The resultant [[Battle of Marsaglia]] on 4 October 1693 ended in a resounding French victory. Turin now lay open to attack but further manpower and supply difficulties prevented Catinat from exploiting his gain, and all the French could get out of their victory was renewed breathing-space to restock what was left of Pinerolo.<ref name=rowlands/> Elsewhere, Noailles secured the valuable seaport of [[Roses, Girona|Rosas]] in Catalonia on 9 June before withdrawing into Roussillon. When his opponent, Medina-Sidonia, abandoned plans to besiege [[Bellver de Cerdanya|Bellver]], both sides entered winter quarters.<ref>Lynn, p. 239.</ref> Meanwhile, the French navy achieved victory in its final fleet action of the war. On 27 June Tourville's combined [[Brest, France|Brest]] and Toulon squadrons ambushed the [[Battle of Lagos (1693)|Smyrna convoy]] (a fleet of between 200–400 Allied merchant vessels travelling under escort to the Mediterranean) as it rounded [[Cape St. Vincent]]. The Allies lost approximately 90 merchant ships with a value of some 30 million livres.<ref>Roger: ''The Command of the Ocean: A Naval History of Britain 1649–1815,'' p. 153. 30 million livres was equivalent to the entire French naval budget for 1692.</ref>\n\n===War and diplomacy: 1694–95===\nFrench arms at Heidelberg, Rosas, Huy, Landen, Charleroi and Marsaglia had achieved considerable battlefield success, but with the severe hardships of 1693 continuing through to the summer of 1694 France was unable to expend the same level of energy and finance for the forthcoming campaign. The crisis reshaped French strategy, forcing commanders to redraft plans to fit the dictates of fiscal shortfalls.<ref>Lynn, p. 241.</ref> In the background, Louis XIV's agents were working hard diplomatically to unhinge the coalition but the Emperor, who had secured with the Allies his 'rights' to the Spanish succession should Charles II die during the conflict, did not desire a peace that would not prove personally advantageous.

On 27 May Marshal Noailles, supported by French warships, soundly defeated the [[Juan Manuel Fernández Pacheco, 8th Marquis of Villena|Marquis of Escalona]]'s Spanish forces at the [[Battle of Torroella]] on the banks of the river [[Ter (river)|Ter]]; the French proceeded to take [[Palamós]] on 10 June, [[Girona|Gerona]] on 29 June, and [[Hostalric]], opening the route to Barcelona. With the Spanish King threatening to make a separate peace with France unless the Allies came to his assistance, William III prepared the Anglo-Dutch fleet for action. Part of the fleet under Admiral [[John Berkeley, 3rd Baron Berkeley of Stratton|Berkeley]] would remain in the north, first leading the disastrous [[attack on Brest|amphibious assault on Brest]] on 18 June, before bombarding French coastal defences at [[Dieppe, Seine-Maritime|Dieppe]], [[Saint-Malo]], [[Le Havre]], and [[Calais]]. The remainder of the fleet under Admiral Russell was ordered to the Mediterranean, linking up with Spanish vessels off [[Cadiz]]. The Allied naval presence compelled the French fleet back to the safety of Toulon, which, in turn, forced Noailles to withdraw to the line of the Ter, harassed en route by General Trinxería's ''[[Miquelet (militia)|miquelets]]''.<ref>Childs (2003), p. 197.</ref> By shielding Barcelona in this way the Allies kept Spain in the war for two more years.<ref>Lynn, p. 246.</ref>\n\n[[File:Die Belagerung von Namur 1695.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Siege of Namur (1695) by [[Huchtenburg|Jan van Huchtenburg]].

In a role reversal of 1692 Coehoorn conducted the siege of the stronghold under William III, and the Electors of Bavaria and Brandenburg. The French had attempted diversions with the [[bombardment of Brussels]], but despite Boufflers' stout defence Namur finally fell on 5 September.<ref>John Childs calls the recapture of Namur the most important event of the Nine Years' War.</ref> The siege had cost the Allies a great deal in men and resources, and had pinned down William III's army through the whole summer campaign; but the recapture of Namur, together with the earlier prize of Huy, had restored the Allied position on the Meuse, and had secured communications between their armies in the Spanish Netherlands and those on the Moselle and Rhine.<ref>Childs (2003), p. 202.</ref>\n\nMeanwhile, the recent fiscal crisis had brought about a transformation in French naval strategy – the Maritime Powers now outstripped France in shipbuilding and arming, and increasingly enjoyed a numerical advantage.<ref>Symcox: ''War, Diplomacy, and Imperialism: 1618–1763,'' 236: For Vauban's ''Memorandum on Privateering, 1695,'' and ''Memorandum on the French Frontier, 1678,'' see Symcox</ref> Suggesting the abandonment of fleet warfare, ''guerre d'escadre'', in favour of commerce-raiding, ''[[Commerce raiding|guerre de course]],'' Vauban advocated the use of the fleet backed by individual shipowners fitting out their own vessels as [[privateer]]s, aimed at destroying the trade of the Maritime Powers. Vauban argued that this strategic change would deprive the enemy of its economic base without costing Louis XIV money that was far more urgently needed to maintain France's armies on land. Privateers cruising either as individuals or in complete squadrons from [[Dunkirk]], St Malo and the smaller ports, achieved significant success. For example, in 1695, the [[André, marquis de Nesmond|Marquis of Nesmond]], with seven ships of the line, captured vessels from the English East India Company that were said to have yielded 10 million livres. In May 1696, [[Jean Bart]] slipped the blockade of Dunkirk and struck a Dutch convoy in the [[North Sea]], burning 45 of its ships; on 18 June 1696 he won the battle at [[Dogger Bank]]; and in May 1697, the [[Bernard Desjean, Baron de Pointis|Baron of Pointis]] with another privateer squadron attacked and [[Raid on Cartagena (1697)|seized Cartagena]], earning him, and the king, a share of 10 million livres.<ref>Lynn, p. 102.</ref>\n\n[[File:Anne-Jules, duc de Noailles (1650-1708).jpg|thumb|170px|Duke of Noailles (1650–1708). Due to illness Vendôme replaced Noailles as French commander in Catalonia in 1695.]]\n\nFor their part, the Allied navy expended more shells on St Malo, Granville, Calais, and Dunkirk; likewise on Palamos in Catalonia where Charles II had appointed the Marquis of Gastañaga as the governor-general. The Allies sent Austrian and German reinforcements under [[Prince George of Hesse-Darmstadt]], a cousin of the Queen of Spain, while the French replaced the ailing Noailles with the [[Louis Joseph de Bourbon, Duke of Vendôme|Duke of Vendôme]] who would become one of Louis XIV's best generals. But the balance of military power was turning dangerously against the French. In Spain, in the Rhineland, and in the Low Countries, Louis XIV's forces only barely held their own: the bombardment of the French channel ports, the threats of invasion, and the loss of Namur were causes of great anxiety for the King at Versailles.<ref>Wolf (1970), p. 589.</ref>\n\nIn the meantime the diplomatic breakthrough was made in Italy. For two years the Duke of Savoy's Minister of Finance, [[Giambattista Gropello, Count of Borgone|Gropello]], and the [[René de Froulay de Tessé|Count of Tessé]] (Catinat's second-in-command), had secretly been negotiating a bi-lateral agreement to end the war in Italy. Central to the discussions were the two French fortresses that flanked the Duke's territory – Pinerolo and Casale, the latter now completely cut off from French assistance.<ref name=rowlands/> By now Victor Amadeus had come to fear the growth of Imperial military power and political influence in the region (now more than he feared the French) and the threat it posed to Savoyard independence. Knowing, therefore, that the Imperials were planning to besiege Casale the Duke proposed that the French garrison surrender to him following a token show of force, after which the fortifications would be dismantled and handed back to the Duke of Mantua.<ref>Childs (2003), p. 198. Victor Amadeus thought it would be to his advantage to have Casale dismantled and neutralized. Because of its position it would then be at the mercy of Savoy.</ref> Louis XIV was compelled to accept, and after a sham siege and nominal resistance Casale surrendered to Amadeus on 9 July 1695; by mid-September the place had been razed.\n\n===Road to Ryswick: 1696–97===\nMost fronts were relatively quiet throughout 1696: the armies in Flanders, along the Rhine, and in Catalonia, marched and counter-marched but little was achieved. Louis XIV's hesitancy to engage with the Allies (despite the confidence of his generals) may have reflected his knowledge of the secret talks that had begun more than a year earlier—with [[François de Callières]] acting for Louis XIV, and [[Jacob Boreel]] and [[Everhard van Weede Dijkvelt]] representing the Dutch.<ref name=\"wolf591\">Wolf (1970), p. 591.</ref> By the spring of 1696 the talks covered the whole panorama of problems that were proving an obstacle to peace. The most difficult of these were the recognition of the Prince of Orange as the King of England and the subsequent status of James II in France; the Dutch demand for a barrier against future French aggression; French tariffs on Dutch commerce; and the territorial settlements in the Rhine–Moselle areas regarding the Reunions and the recent conquests, particularly the strategically important city of Strasbourg.<ref name=\"wolf591\"/> Louis XIV had succeeded in establishing the principle that a new treaty would be fixed within the framework of the Treaties of Westphalia and Nijmegen, and the Truce of Ratisbon, but with the Emperor's demands for Strasbourg, and William III's insistence that he be recognized as King of England ''before'' the conclusion of hostilities, it hardly seemed worthwhile in calling for a peace conference.<ref>Wolf (1970), pp. 591–92.</ref>\n\nIn Italy the secret negotiations were proving more productive, with the French possession of Pinerolo now central to the talks. When Amadeus threatened to besiege Pinerolo the French, concluding that its defence was not now possible, agreed to hand back the stronghold on condition that its fortifications were demolished. The terms were formalised as the [[Treaty of Turin (1696)|Treaty of Turin]] on 29 August 1696, by which provision Louis XIV also returned, intact, Montmélian, Nice, Villefranche, [[Susa (TO)|Susa]], and other small towns.<ref>Rowlands describes this as little short of a humiliation for Louis XIV when set alongside French demands in the summer of 1690.</ref> Amongst other concessions Louis XIV also promised not to interfere in Savoy's religious policy regarding the Vaudois, provided the Duke prevents any communication between them and French Huguenots. In return, Amadeus agreed to abandon the Grand Alliance and join with Louis XIV – if necessary – to secure the neutralisation of northern Italy. The Emperor, diplomatically outmanoeuvred, was compelled to accept peace in the region by signing the [[Treaty of Vigevano]] of 7 October, to which the French immediately acceded. Italy was neutralised and the Nine Years' War in the peninsula came to an end. Savoy had emerged as an independent sovereign House and a key second-rank power: the Alps, rather than the River Po, would be the boundary of France in the south-east.<ref name=\"rowlands\" />\n\nThe Treaty of Turin started a scramble for peace. With the continual disruption of trade and commerce politicians from England and the Dutch Republic were desirous for an end to the war. France was also facing economic exhaustion, but above all Louis XIV was becoming convinced that Charles II of Spain was near death and he knew that the break-up of the coalition would be essential if France was to benefit from the dynastic battle ahead.<ref>McKay; Scott, p. 51.</ref> The contending parties agreed to meet at [[Rijswijk|Ryswick]] (Rijswijk) and come to a negotiated settlement. But as talks continued through 1697, so did the fighting. The main French goal that year in the Spanish Netherlands was [[Ath]]. Vauban and Catinat (now with troops freed from the Italian front) [[Siege of Ath (1697)|invested]] the town on 15 May while Marshals Boufflers and Villeroi covered the siege; after an assault on 5 June the Count of Roeux surrendered and the garrison marched out two days later. The Rhineland theatre in 1697 was again quiet: the French commander, [[Claude de Choiseul, Marquis of Francières|Marshal Choiseul]] (who had replaced the sick de Lorge the previous year), was content to remain behind his fortified lines. Although Baden took Ebernberg on 27 September, news of the peace brought an end to the desultory campaign, and both armies drew back from one another. In Catalonia, however, French forces (now also reinforced with troops from Italy) achieved considerable success when Vendôme, commanding some 32,000 troops, besieged and captured Barcelona.<ref>Childs states 25,000 French troops.</ref> The garrison, under Prince George of Hesse-Darmstadt, capitulated on 10 August. Yet it had been a hard-fought contest: French casualties amounted to about 9,000, and the Spanish had suffered some 12,000 killed, wounded or lost.<ref>Lynn, p. 261.</ref>\n\n==North American theatre (King William's War)==\n[[File:Quebec 1690.jpg|thumb|250px|19th-century print showing Quebec batteries firing on William Phips' squadron during October 1690.]]\n\nThe European war was reflected in North America, where it was known as [[King William's War]], though the North American contest was very different in meaning and scale. The European war declaration arrived amid [[Beaver Wars|long-running tensions]] over control of the [[fur trade]], economically vital to both French and English colonies, and influence over the [[Iroquois]], who controlled much of that trade.<ref>Lovejoy: ''The Glorious Revolution in America'', 215–18</ref> The French were determined to hold the St. Lawrence country and to extend their power over the vast basin of the [[Mississippi River|Mississippi]].<ref>Elson: ''History of the United States of America,'' I, 226–27</ref> Moreover, [[Hudson Bay]] was a focal point of dispute between the Protestant English and Catholic French colonists, both of whom claimed a share of its occupation and trade. Although important to the colonists, the North American theatre of the Nine Years' War was of secondary importance to European statesmen. Despite numerical superiority, the English colonists suffered repeated defeats as [[New France]] effectively organised its French troops, local militia and [[Native Americans in the United States|Indian]] allies (notably the [[Algonquin people|Algonquins]] and [[Abenaki]]s), to attack frontier settlements.<ref name=taylor290>Taylor: ''The Thirteen Colonies: The Settling of North America,'' p. 290.</ref> Almost all resources sent to the colonies by England were to defend the English [[Caribbean|West Indies]], the crown jewels of the empire.\n\nFriction over Indian relations worsened in 1688 with French incursions against the Iroquois in upstate New York, and with Indian raids against smaller settlements in [[Province of Maine|Maine]].<ref>Lovejoy: ''The Glorious Revolution in America'', p. 218</ref> The Governor General of New France, [[Louis de Buade de Frontenac]], capitalising on disorganisation in New York and New England following the collapse of the [[Dominion of New England]],<ref>Lovejoy: ''The Glorious Revolution in America'', p. 315.</ref> expanded the war with a series of raids on the northern borders of the English settlements: first was the destruction of [[Dover, New Hampshire]], in July 1689; followed by [[Bristol, Maine|Pemaquid]], Maine, in August.<ref>Elson: ''History of the United States of America,'' I, p. 227–28.</ref> In February 1690 [[Schenectady massacre|Schenectady]] in [[Province of New York|New York]] was attacked; massacres at [[Raid on Salmon Falls|Salmon Falls]] and [[Battle of Falmouth (1690)|Casco Bay]] followed.

In August a land force commanded by Colonel Winthrop set off for [[Montreal]], while a naval force, commanded by the future governor of [[Province of Massachusetts Bay|Massachusetts]], [[William Phips|Sir William Phips]] (who earlier on 11 May had [[Battle of Port Royal (1690)|seized the capital]] of French [[Acadia]], [[Habitation at Port-Royal|Port Royal]]), set sail for [[Quebec City|Quebec]] via the [[Saint Lawrence River]].

The [[Iroquois|Iroquois Five Nations]], abandoned by their English allies, were obliged to open separate negotiations, and by [[Great Peace of Montreal|the treaty of 1701]] they agreed to remain neutral in any future Anglo-French war.<ref>Bromley, pp. 489–90.</ref>\n\n==Asia and the Caribbean==\n[[File:Lagos 1693.jpg|thumb|left|250px| The Battle of [[Lagos, Portugal|Lagos]] June 1693; French victory and the capture of the Smyrna convoy was the most significant English mercantile loss of the war.]]\nWhen news of the European war reached Asia, English, French and Dutch colonial governors and merchants quickly took up the struggle. In October 1690 the French Admiral [[Abraham Duquesne-Guitton]] sailed into [[Chennai|Madras]] to bombard the Anglo-Dutch fleet; this attack proved foolhardy but extended the war into the Far East.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Wolf|first1=John|title=The Emergence of the Great Powers; 1685-1715|date=1962|publisher=Harper & Row|isbn=0061397504|page=47}}</ref> In 1693 the Dutch launched an expedition against their French commercial rivals at [[Pondicherry district|Pondichéry]] on the south-eastern coast of [[India]]; the small garrison under [[François Martin (Pondicherry)|François Martin]] was overwhelmed and surrendered on 6 September.<ref>Lynn, p. 262.</ref> \n\nThe [[Caribbean]] and the Americas were historically an area of conflict between England and Spain but the two were now Allies while outside North America French interests were far less significant. [[Saint Kitts]] twice changed hands and there was sporadic conflict in [[Jamaica]], [[Martinique]] and [[Hispaniola]] but mutual suspicion between the English and Spanish limited joint operations. The Allies had the naval advantage in these isolated areas, though it proved impossible to keep the French from supplying their colonial forces.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Wolf|first1=John|title=The Emergence of the Great Powers; 1685-1715|date=1962|publisher=Harper & Row|isbn=0061397504|page=47}}</ref>\n\nBy 1693, it was clear the campaigns in Flanders had not dealt a decisive blow to either the Dutch Republic or England and so the French switched to attacking their trade. The [[Battle_of_Lagos_(1693)|Battle of Lagos]] in 1693 and the loss of the Smyrna convoy caused intense anger among English merchants who demanded increased global protection from the navy. In 1696, a combination of regular French naval forces and [[Privateer|privateers]] went to the Caribbean hoping to intercept the Spanish silver fleet; this was a double threat since capture of the silver would give France a major financial boost while the Spanish ships also carried English cargoes. This failed but combined with de Pointis' expedition of 1697 demonstrated the vulnerability of English interests in the Caribbean and North America; their protection in future conflicts became a matter of urgency.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Satsuma|first1=Shinsuke|title=Britain and Colonial Maritime War in the Early Eighteenth Century: Silver, Seapower and the Atlantic|date=2013|publisher=Boydell Press|isbn=1843838621|pages=30-34}}</ref>\n\n==Treaty of Ryswick==\n{{Main article|Treaty of Ryswick}}\n[[File:Europe c. 1700.png|thumb|300px|Map of European borders as they stood after the Treaty of Ryswick and just prior to Louis XIV's last great war, the War of the Spanish Succession.]]\n\nThe peace conference opened in May 1697 in William III's [[Huis ter Nieuwburg|palace]] at Ryswick near [[The Hague]]. The Swedes were the official mediators, but it was through the private efforts of Boufflers and [[William Bentinck, 1st Earl of Portland|William Bentinck, the Earl of Portland]] that the major issues were resolved. William III had no intention of continuing the war or pressing for Leopold I's claims in the Rhineland or for the Spanish succession: it seemed more important for Dutch and British security to obtain Louis XIV's recognition of the 1688 revolution.<ref name=mckay52>McKay; Scott, p. 52.</ref>\n\nBy the terms of the [[Treaty of Ryswick]], Louis XIV kept the whole of Alsace, including Strasbourg. Lorraine returned to its duke (although France retained rights to march troops through the territory), and the French abandoned all gains on the right bank of the Rhine – Philppsburg, Breisach, [[Freiburg]] and [[Kehl]]. Additionally, the new French fortresses of La Pile, Mont Royal and Fort Louis were to be demolished. To win favour with Madrid over the Spanish succession question, Louis XIV evacuated Catalonia in Spain and Luxembourg, [[Chimay]], Mons, Courtrai, Charleroi and Ath in the Low Countries.<ref>Childs (2003), p. 205.</ref> The Maritime Powers asked for no territory, but the Dutch were given a favourable commercial treaty, of which the most important provision was to relax regulations to favour Dutch trade and return to the French [[tariff]] of 1664. Although Louis XIV continued to shelter James II, he now recognised William III as King of England, and undertook not to actively support the candidature of James II's son.<ref>Clark, p. 252–53.</ref> He also gave way over the Palatinate and Cologne issues. Beyond this, the French gained recognition of their ownership of the western half of the island of Hispaniola.\n\nThe representatives of the Dutch Republic, England, and Spain signed the treaty on 20 September 1697. Emperor Leopold I, desperate for a continuation of the war so as to strengthen his own claims to the Spanish succession, initially resisted the treaty, but because he was still at war with the Turks, and could not face fighting France alone, he also sought terms and signed on 30 October.<ref name=mckay52/> The Emperor's finances were in a bad state, and the dissatisfaction aroused by the raising of [[Electorate of Brunswick-Lüneburg|Hanover]] to electoral rank had impaired Leopold I's influence in Germany. The Protestant princes had also blamed him for the religious clause in the treaty, which stipulated that the lands of the Reunions that France was to surrender would remain Catholic, even those that had been forcibly converted—a clear defiance of the Westphalia settlement.<ref>Bromley, p. 473–74.</ref> However, the Emperor had netted an enormous accretion of power: Leopold I's son, [[Joseph I, Holy Roman Emperor|Joseph]], had been named [[King of the Romans]] (1690), and the Emperor's candidate for the Polish throne, [[Augustus II the Strong|August of Saxony]], had carried the day over Louis XIV's candidate, the [[François Louis, Prince of Conti|Prince of Conti]]. Additionally, Prince Eugene of Savoy's decisive victory over the Ottoman Turks at the [[Battle of Zenta]] – leading to the [[Treaty of Karlowitz]] in 1699 – consolidated the Austrian Habsburgs and tipped the European balance of power in favour of the Emperor.<ref>Wolf (1970), p. 594.</ref>\n\nThe war had allowed William III to destroy militant Jacobitism and helped bring Scotland and Ireland under more direct control. England emerged as a great economic and naval power and became an important player in European affairs, allowing her to use her wealth and energy in world politics to the fullest advantage.<ref name=\"mckay52\"/> William III also continued to prioritise the security of the Dutch Republic, and in 1698 the Dutch garrisoned a series of fortresses in the Spanish Netherlands as a barrier to French attack – future foreign policy would centre on the maintenance and extension of these barrier fortresses.<ref>McKay; Scott, p. 53.</ref> However, the question of the Spanish inheritance was not discussed at Ryswick, and it remained the most important unsolved question of European politics. Within three years Charles II of Spain would be dead, and Louis XIV and the Grand Alliance would again plunge Europe into conflict – the [[War of the Spanish Succession]].\n\n==Weapons, technology, and the art of war==\n\n===Military developments===\n[[File:Mayence 1689.jpg|thumb|250px|Siege of Mainz 1689. Many of the larger fortified complexes had [[citadel]]s. Once the town had been captured the garrison would withdraw into the citadel, which then had to be separately reduced.]]\n\nThe campaign season typically lasted through May to October; due to lack of fodder campaigns in winter were rare, but the French practice of storing food and provisions in magazines brought them considerable advantage, often enabling them to take to the field weeks before their foes.<ref>Lynn, p. 54–55.</ref> Nevertheless, military operations during the Nine Years' War did not produce decisive results. The war was dominated by what may be called 'positional warfare' – the construction, defence, and attack of [[Star fort|fortresses]] and entrenched lines. Positional warfare played a wide variety of roles: fortresses controlled bridgeheads and passes, guarded supply routes, and served as storehouses and magazines. However, fortresses hampered the ability to follow success on the battlefield – defeated armies could flee to friendly fortifications, enabling them to recover and rebuild their numbers from less threatened fronts.<ref>Lynn, p. 80–81.</ref> Many lesser commanders welcomed these relatively predictable, static operations to mask their lack of military ability.<ref name=\"chandler235\">Chandler, p. 235.</ref> As [[Daniel Defoe]] observed in 1697, \"Now it is frequent to have armies of 50,000 men of a side spend the whole campaign in dodging – or, as it is genteelly called – observing one another, and then march off into winter quarters.\"<ref name=\"chandler235\" /> In fact, during the Nine Years' War field armies had waxed to nearly 100,000 men in 1695, the strain of which had reduced the Maritime Powers to a fiscal crisis while the French struggled under the weight of a shattered economy.<ref name=\"childs1\">Childs (1991), p. 1.</ref>\nYet there were aggressive commanders: William III, Boufflers, and Luxembourg had the will to win but their methods were hampered by numbers, supply, and communications.<ref name=\"childs1\" /> The French commanders were also restricted by Louis XIV and Louvois who distrusted field campaigns, preferring Vauban, the taker of fortifications, rather than campaigns of movement.<ref>Wolf (1962), p. 44.</ref>\n\n[[File:Bombardement Bruxelles 1695 01.jpg|250px|left|thumb|[[Bombardment of Brussels]] 1695. Fortifications consisted of low-level, geometric earthworks; the ground plan was polygonal with a pentangle bastion at each salient angle, covered by ravelins, hornworks, crownworks, demi-lunes.]]\n\nAnother contributing factor for the lack of decisive action was the necessity to fight for secure resources. Armies were expected to support themselves in the field by imposing contributions (taxing local populations) upon a hostile, or even neutral, territory. Subjecting a particular area to contributions was deemed more important than pursuing a defeated army from the battlefield to destroy it. It was primarily financial concerns and availability of resources that shaped campaigns, as armies struggled to outlast the enemy in a long war of [[Attrition warfare|attrition]].<ref>Lynn, pp. 372–373.</ref> The only decisive action during the whole war came in Ireland where William III crushed the forces of James II in a campaign for legitimacy and control of Britain and Ireland. But unlike Ireland, Louis XIV's Continental wars were never fought without compromise: the fighting provided a foundation for diplomatic negotiations and did not dictate a solution.<ref>Lynn, pp. 264–65.</ref>\n\nThe major advancement in weapon technology in the 1690s was the introduction of the [[flintlock]] [[musket]]. The new firing mechanism provided superior rates of fire and accuracy over the cumbersome [[matchlock]]s. But the adoption of the flintlock was uneven, and until 1697 for every three Allied soldiers that were equipped with the new muskets, two soldiers were still handicapped by matchlocks:<ref>Chandler, p. 78.</ref> French second-line troops were issued matchlocks as late as 1703.<ref name=\"bromley747\">Bromley, p. 747.</ref> These weapons were further enhanced with the development of the socket-[[bayonet]]. Its predecessor, the [[plug bayonet]] – jammed down the firearm's barrel – not only prevented the musket from firing but was also a clumsy weapon that took time to fix properly, and even more time to unfix. In contrast, the socket-bayonet could be drawn over the musket's muzzle and locked into place by a lug, converting the musket into a short [[Pike (weapon)|pike]] yet leaving it capable of fire.<ref>Childs (2003), p. 155. Different authorities credit both Hugh Mackay and Vauban for the socket bayonet.</ref> The disadvantage of the pike came to be widely recognised: at the [[Battle of Fleurus (1690)|Battle of Fleurus]] in 1690, German battalions armed only with the musket repulsed French cavalry attacks more effectively than units conventionally armed with the pike, while Catinat had abandoned his pikes altogether before undertaking his Alpine campaign against Savoy.<ref name=\"bromley747\" />\n\n===Naval developments===\nIn 1688 the most powerful navies were the French, English, and Dutch; the Spanish and Portuguese navies had suffered serious declines in the 17th century.<ref>Bromley, p. 790.</ref> The largest French ships of the period were the [[French ship Soleil-Royal (1670)|''Soleil Royal'']] and the [[French ship Royal Louis (1668)|''Royal Louis'']], but while each was rated for 120 guns, they never carried this full complement and were too large for practical purposes: the former only sailed on one campaign and was destroyed at La Hogue; the latter languished in port until sold in 1694. By the 1680s, French ship-design was at least equal to its English and Dutch counterparts, and by the Nine Years' War the French fleet had surpassed ships of the [[Royal Navy]], whose designs stagnated in the 1690s.<ref>Roger: ''The Command of the Ocean: A Naval History of Britain 1649–1815,'' p. 219–21.</ref> Innovation in the Royal Navy, however, did not cease. At some stage in the 1690s, for example, English ships began to employ the [[Steering wheel (ship)|ship's wheel]], greatly improving their performance, particularly in heavy weather. (The French navy did not adopt the wheel for another thirty years).<ref>Roger: ''The Command of the Ocean: A Naval History of Britain 1649–1815,'' p. 222.</ref>\n\n[[File:Soleil Royal-Gaston Braun.jpg|thumb|250px|French warship ''Soleil Royal'']]\n\nCombat between naval fleets was decided by cannon duels delivered by ships in [[line of battle]]; [[fireships]] were also used but were mainly successful against anchored and stationary targets, while the new [[bomb vessel]]s operated best in bombarding targets on shore. Sea battles rarely proved decisive. Fleets faced the almost impossible task of inflicting enough damage on ships and men to win a clear victory: ultimate success depended not on tactical brilliance but on sheer weight of numbers.<ref>Lynn, p. 93.</ref> Here Louis XIV was at a disadvantage: without as large a maritime commerce as benefited the Allies, the French were unable to supply as many experienced sailors for their navy. Most importantly, though, Louis XIV had to concentrate his resources on the army at the expense of the fleet, enabling the Dutch, and the English in particular, to outdo the French in ship construction. However, naval actions were comparatively uncommon and, just like battles on land, the goal was generally to outlast rather than to destroy one's opponent. Louis XIV regarded his navy as an extension of his army – the French fleet's most important role was to protect the French coast from enemy invasion. Louis used his fleet to support land and amphibious operations or the bombardment of coastal targets, designed to draw enemy resources from elsewhere and thus aid his land campaigns on the continent.<ref>Lynn, p. 103.</ref>\n\nOnce the Allies had secured a clear superiority in numbers the French found it prudent not to contest them in fleet action. At the start of the Nine Years' War the French fleet had 118 rated vessels and a total of 295 ships of all types. By the end of the war the French had 137 rated ships. In contrast, the English fleet started the war with 173 vessels of all types, and ended it with 323. Between 1694 and 1697 the French built 19 first- to fifth-rated ships; the English built 58 such vessels, and the Dutch constructed 22. Thus the maritime powers outbuilt the French at a rate of four vessels to one.<ref>Lynn, p. 97.</ref>\n\n==Notes==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n==References==\n{{Refbegin}}\n* Aubrey, Philip.
