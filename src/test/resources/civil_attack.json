The CIA never responded.{{sfn|Wright|2006|p=340}}\n\nThe same day in July, Margarette Gillespie, an FBI analyst working in the CTC, was told to review material about the Malaysia meeting. She was not told of the participants' presence in the U.S. The CIA gave Gillespie surveillance photos of Mihdhar and Hazmi from the meeting to show to FBI counterterrorism, but did not tell her their significance. The Intelink database informed her not to share intelligence material on the meeting to criminal investigators. When shown the photos, the FBI were refused more details on their significance, and also did not receive Mihdhar's date of birth or passport number.{{sfn|Wright|2006|pp=340–343}} In late August 2001, Gillespie told the [[Immigration and Naturalization Service|INS]], the State Department, the [[United States Customs Service|Customs Service]], and the FBI to put Hazmi and Mihdhar on their watchlists, but the FBI was prohibited from using criminal agents in the search for the duo, which hindered their efforts.{{sfn|Wright|2006|pp=352–353}}\n\nAlso in July, a [[Phoenix, Arizona|Phoenix]]-based FBI agent sent a message to FBI headquarters, Alec Station, and to FBI agents in New York, alerting them to \"the possibility of a coordinated effort by Osama bin Laden to send students to the United States to attend civil aviation universities and colleges.\" The agent, Kenneth Williams, suggested the need to interview all flight school managers and identify all Arab students seeking flight training.{{sfn|Wright|2006|p=350}} In July, Jordan alerted the U.S. that al-Qaeda was planning an attack on the U.S.; \"months later\", Jordan notified the U.S. that the attack's codename was \"The Big Wedding\", and that it involved airplanes.{{sfn|Yitzhak|2016|p=218}}\n\nOn August 6, the CIA's Presidential Daily Brief, designated \"For the President Only\", was entitled [[Bin Ladin Determined To Strike in US|\"Bin Ladin Determined to Strike in U.S.\"]] The memo noted that \"The FBI information... indicates patterns of suspicious activity in this country consistent with preparations for hijackings or other types of attacks.\"<ref>{{cite web|title=THE OSAMA BIN LADEN FILE: National Security Archive Electronic Briefing Book No. 343|url=http://nsarchive.gwu.edu/NSAEBB/NSAEBB343/|website=The National Security Archive|publisher=The National Security Archive|accessdate=March 14, 2016}}</ref>\n\nIn mid-August, one [[Minnesota]] flight school alerted the FBI to [[Zacarias Moussaoui]], who had asked \"suspicious questions.\" The FBI found that he was a radical who had traveled to Pakistan, and the INS arrested him for overstaying his [[France|French]] visa. Their request to search his laptop was denied by FBI headquarters due to the lack of [[probable cause]].{{sfn|Wright|2006|pp=350–351}}\n\nThe failures in intelligence-sharing were attributed to 1995 [[United States Department of Justice|Justice Department]] policies limiting intelligence sharing, combined with CIA and NSA reluctance in revealing \"sensitive sources and methods\" such as tapped phones.{{sfn|Wright|2006|pp=342–343}} Testifying before the [[9/11 Commission]] in April 2004, then-[[Attorney General]] [[John Ashcroft]] recalled that the \"single greatest structural cause for the September 11th problem was the wall that segregated or separated criminal investigators and intelligence agents.\"{{sfn|Javorsek II|Rose|Marshall|Leitner|2015|p=742}} Clarke also wrote that \"There were failures in the organizations... failures to get information to the right place at the right time...\"{{sfn|Clarke|2004|p=238}}\n\n==Attacks==\n{{Further|Timeline for the day of the September 11 attacks}}\n\n[[File:Flight paths of hijacked planes-September 11 attacks.jpg|thumb|upright=1.3|Flight paths of the four planes used on September 11]]\n\nEarly on the morning of September 11, 2001, [[Hijackers in the September 11 attacks|19 hijackers]] took control of four commercial airliners (two [[Boeing 757]] and two [[Boeing 767]]) en route to California (three headed to [[Los Angeles International Airport|LAX]] in [[Los Angeles]], and one to [[San Francisco International Airport|SFO]] in [[San Francisco]]) after takeoffs from [[Logan International Airport]] in [[Boston]], [[Massachusetts]]; [[Newark Liberty International Airport]] in [[Newark, New Jersey]]; and [[Washington Dulles International Airport]] in [[Loudoun County, Virginia|Loudoun]] and [[Fairfax County, Virginia|Fairfax]] counties in [[Virginia]].<ref name=\"911-ch1\" /> Large planes with long flights were selected for hijacking because they would be heavily fueled.<ref name=\"Chap7\" /><!--weren't early morning flights also chosen because they would have fewer passengers to overcome?-->\n\nThe four flights were:\n* [[American Airlines Flight 11]]: a Boeing 767 aircraft, departed Logan Airport at 7:59&nbsp;a.m. en route to Los Angeles with a crew of 11 and 76 passengers, not including five hijackers.

The victims were [[Andrew Goodman]] and [[Michael Schwerner|Michael \"Mickey\" Schwerner]] from [[New York City]], and [[James Chaney]] from [[Meridian, Mississippi]]. All three were associated with the [[Council of Federated Organizations]] (COFO) and its member organization the [[Congress of Racial Equality]] (CORE). They had been working with the [[Freedom Summer]] campaign by attempting to register African Americans in Mississippi to vote. This registration effort was a part of contesting over 70 years of laws and practices that supported a systematic policy of [[Disenfranchisement after the Reconstruction Era|disenfranchisement of potential black voters]] by several southern states that began in 1890.\n\nThe three men had traveled from Meridian, Mississippi, to the community of Longdale to talk with congregation members at a church that had been burned. The trio was thereafter arrested following a traffic stop outside Philadelphia, Mississippi, for speeding, escorted to the local jail and held for a number of hours.<ref name=PBS>{{cite web|title=General Article: Murder in Mississippi|url=https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/americanexperience/features/general-article/freedomsummer-murder/|website=American Experience|publisher=PBS|accessdate=14 November 2016}}</ref> As the three left town in their car, they were followed by law enforcement and others. Before leaving Neshoba County their car was pulled over and all three were abducted, driven to another location, and shot at close range. The three men's bodies were then transported to an earthen dam where they were buried.<ref name=PBS/>\n\nThe disappearance of the three men was initially investigated as a missing persons case. The civil rights workers' burnt-out car was found near a swamp three days after their disappearance.<ref>{{cite web|title=\"Mississippi Burning\" murders|url=http://www.cbsnews.com/pictures/mississippi-burning-murders/10/|publisher=CBS News|accessdate=2015-12-16}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |last1=Bayless |first1=Les|title=Three who gave their lives: Remembering the martyrs of Mississippi Freedom Summer, 1964|url=http://www.hartford-hwp.com/archives/45a/046.html|publisher=People's Weekly World|accessdate=1 December 2016}}</ref> An extensive search of the area was conducted by the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation]] (FBI), local and state authorities, and four hundred United States Navy sailors.<ref>{{cite news|title=We're Stymied, Rights Search Leaders Admit|url=https://cdnc.ucr.edu/cgi-bin/cdnc?a=d&d=DS19640701.2.18&txq=andrew+goodman |accessdate=1 December 2016|work=Desert Sun|issue=Number 283|publisher=UPI|date=1 July 1964}}</ref> The three men's bodies were only discovered two months later thanks to a tip-off.

After the state government refused to prosecute, in 1967 the United States federal government charged 18 individuals with civil rights violations. Seven were convicted and received relatively minor sentences for their actions. Outrage over the activists' disappearances helped gain passage of the [[Voting Rights Act of 1965]].<ref>{{cite book|last1=Garraty|first1=John A.|title=The Reader's Companion to American History |date=1991 |publisher=Houghton Mifflin Harcourt Publishing Company|isbn=1784027804 |url=http://www.history.com/topics/black-history/freedom-summer|accessdate=4 December 2016}}</ref>\n\nForty-one years after the murders took place, one perpetrator, [[Edgar Ray Killen]], was charged by the state of Mississippi for his part in the crimes.

Bombings, murders, vandalism, and intimidation were tactics used by [[White supremacy|white supremacists]] in order to discourage black Mississippians and their Northern supporters. In 1961 [[Freedom Riders]], who challenged the segregation of interstate buses and related facilities, were attacked on their route. In September 1962, the [[Ole Miss riot of 1962|University of Mississippi riots]] had occurred in order to prevent [[James Meredith]] from enrolling at the school.\n\nThe Mississippi White Knights of the Ku Klux Klan, a [[Ku Klux Klan]] splinter group, was founded and led by [[Samuel Bowers]] of [[Laurel, Mississippi]]. As the summer of 1964 approached, white Mississippians prepared for what they perceived was an invasion from the north. College students had been recruited in order to aid local activists who were conducting grassroots community organizing, voter registration education and drives in the state. Media reports exaggerated the number of youths expected.<ref name=\"media exaggerated\">{{cite journal|title=Murder in Mississippi|first=Don|last=Whitehead |date=September 1970 |work=Reader's Digest |page=196}}</ref> One [[Council of Federated Organizations]] (COFO) representative is quoted as saying that nearly 30,000 individuals would visit Mississippi during the summer.<ref name=\"media exaggerated\"/> Such reports had a \"jarring impact\" on white Mississippians and many responded by joining the White Knights.<ref name=\"media exaggerated\"/> More belligerent than other KKK groups, the White Knights soon attracted a following of nearly 10,000 white Mississippians.{{citation needed|date=January 2015}}\n\nIn 1890 Mississippi had passed a new constitution, supported by additional laws, which effectively excluded most black Mississippians from registering or voting. This status quo had long been enforced by economic boycotts and violence. The [[Congress of Racial Equality]] (CORE) wanted to address this problem by setting up places called [[Freedom Schools]] and starting voting registration drives in the state. Freedom schools were established in order to educate, encourage, and register the disenfranchised black citizens.<ref name=\"notification\">{{cite book |title=We Are Not Afraid|chapter=June 21, 1964 |first=Seth|last=Cagin|author2= Philip Dray |year=1988 |publisher=Bantam Books |page={{Page needed|date=March 2013}}}}</ref> CORE members James Chaney, from Mississippi, and Michael Schwerner from New York intended to set up a Freedom School for black people in Neshoba County to try to prepare them to pass the comprehension and literacy tests required by the state.\n[[File:FBI Poster of Missing Civil Rights Workers.jpg|thumb|170px|[[Missing persons]] poster created by the [[FBI]] in 1964, shows the photographs of Goodman, Chaney, and Schwerner.]]\n\n===Registering others to vote===\nOn [[Memorial Day]] 1964, Schwerner and Chaney spoke to the congregation at Mount Zion Methodist Church in Longdale, Mississippi, about setting up a Freedom School.<ref name=speech>{{cite book |title=We Are Not Afraid|chapter=June 21, 1964 |first=Seth|last=Cagin|author2=Philip Dray |year=1988 |publisher=Bantam Books |page=2}}</ref> Schwerner implored the members to register to vote, saying, \"you have been slaves too long, we can help you help yourselves\".<ref name=speech /> The White Knights learned of Schwerner's voting drive in Neshoba County and soon developed a plot to hinder the work and ultimately destroy their efforts. The White Knights wanted to lure CORE workers to Neshoba County, so they attacked congregation members and torched the church, burning it to the ground.\n\nOn June 21, 1964, Chaney, Goodman, and Schwerner met at the [[Meridian, Mississippi|Meridian]] COFO headquarters before traveling to Longdale to investigate the destruction of the Mount Zion Church.

They decided to head west on [[Mississippi Highway 16|Highway 16]] to Philadelphia, the seat of Neshoba County, then take southbound [[Mississippi Highway 19|Highway 19]] to Meridian, figuring it would be the faster route. The time was approaching three in the afternoon, and they were to be in Meridian by four.\n\nThe CORE station wagon had barely passed the Philadelphia city limits when one of its tires went flat, and Deputy Sheriff [[Cecil Price|Cecil Ray Price]] turned on his dashboard-mounted red light and followed them.<ref name=\"notification\"/> The trio stopped near the Beacon and Main Street fork.

They were taken to the Neshoba County jail on Myrtle Street, a block from the courthouse.\n\nIn the Meridian office, workers became alarmed when the 4 p.m. deadline passed without word from the three activists. By 4:45&nbsp;p.m., they notified the COFO Jackson office that the trio had not returned from Neshoba County.<ref name=\"notification\"/> The CORE workers called area authorities but did not learn anything; the contacted offices said they had not seen the civil rights workers.<ref name=\"notification\"/>\n\n==Masterminding the conspiracy==\n[[File:Mississippi KKK Conspiracy Murders June 21 1964 Parties To The Conspiracy.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Parties to the conspiracy; Top row: [[Lawrence A.

Tucker, 36, was not a member of the White Knights, but he was a building contractor who worked for Burrage. The White Knights gave Tucker the assignment of getting rid of the CORE station wagon driven by the workers. White Knights Imperial Wizard [[Samuel Bowers|Samuel H. Bowers]], who served with the [[U.S. Navy]] during World War II, was not apprehended on December 4, 1964, but he was implicated the following year.

Before his friend Lawrence A. Rainey was elected sheriff in 1963, [[Cecil Price|Cecil R.

The 26-year-old Price was the only person who witnessed the entire event. He arrested the three men, released them the night of the murders, and chased them down state highway 19 toward Meridian, eventually re-capturing them at the intersection near House, Mississippi. Price and the other nine men escorted them north along highway 19 to Rock Cut Road, where they forced a stop and murdered the three civil rights workers.\n\nKillen went to Meridian earlier that Sunday to organize and recruit men for the job to be carried out in Neshoba County.<ref name=organizejob>{{cite book |title=We Are Not Afraid|chapter=Rock Cut Road |author1=Seth Cagin |author2=Philip Dray |year=1988 |publisher =Bantam Books |page=278}}</ref> Before the men left for Philadelphia, Travis M. Barnette, 36, went to his Meridian home to take care of a sick family member. Barnette owned a Meridian garage and was a member of the White Knights. Alton W. Roberts, 26, was a [[dishonorably discharged]] U.S. Marine who worked as a salesman in Meridian. Roberts, standing at {{convert|6|ft|3|in|m|abbr=on}} and weighing in at {{convert|270|lbs|kg|abbr=on}}, was a formidable foe and renowned for his short temper. According to witnesses, Roberts shot both Goodman and Schwerner at point blank range. He also shot Chaney in the head after another accomplice, James Jordan, shot Chaney in the abdomen.  Roberts said \"Are you that nigger lover?\" to Schwerner, and shooting him after the latter responded, \"Sir, I know just how you feel.\" Jimmy K. Arledge, 27, and Jimmy Snowden, 31, were both Meridian commercial drivers. Arledge, a high school drop-out, and Snowden, a U.S. Army veteran, were present during the murders. After the second arrest by Price, Arledge would drive the CORE station wagon from state highway 492 to Rock Cut Road.\n\nJerry M. Sharpe, Billy W. Posey, and Jimmy L. Townsend were all from Philadelphia. Sharpe, 21, ran a pulp wood supply house. Posey, 28, a Williamsville, Mississippi automobile mechanic, owned a 1958 red and white Chevrolet; the car was considered fast and was chosen over Sharpe's. The youngest was Townsend, 17; he left high school in 1964 to work at Posey's [[Phillips 66]] garage. Horace D. Barnette, 25, was Travis' younger half-brother; he had a 1957 two-toned blue [[Ford Fairlane (Americas)|Ford Fairlane]] sedan.<ref name=\"akinsbusiness\"/> Horace Barnette's car is the one the group took after Posey's car broke down. Officials say that James Jordan, 38, killed Chaney. He confessed his crimes to the federal authorities in exchange for a plea deal.{{citation needed|date=July 2014}}\n\n===Pursuit on Highway 19===\nAfter Chaney, Goodman, and Schwerner's release from the Neshoba County jail around 10 p.m. on June 21, they were followed almost immediately by Deputy Sheriff Price in his 1957 white Chevrolet sedan patrol car.<ref name=releasedtenpm>{{cite book |title=We Are Not Afraid|chapter=Rock Cut Road |author1=Seth Cagin |author2=Philip Dray |year=1988 |publisher=Bantam Books |pages=285–286}}</ref> Soon afterward, the civil rights workers left the city limits located along Hospital Road and headed south on state Highway 19. The workers arrived at Pilgrim's store, where they may have been inclined to stop and use the telephone, but the presence of a Mississippi Highway Safety patrol car, manned by Officer Wiggs and Poe, most likely dissuaded them. They continued south toward Meridian.\n[[File:Mississippi KKK Conspiracy Murders June 21 1964 CORE Ford Station Wagon Location.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Ford Station Wagon location near the Bogue Chitto River near Highway 21 ({{coord|32|52|54.15|N|88|56|16.87|W}})]]\nThe [[Lynching|lynch mob]] members, who were in Barnette's and Posey's cars, were drinking while arguing who would kill the three young men. Eventually Philadelphia Police Officer Burkes drove up to Horace D. Barnette's car and told the group: \"They're going on 19 toward Meridian. Follow them!\" After a quick rendezvous with Philadelphia police officer Richard Willis, Price was in pursuit of the three civil rights workers.\n\nPosey's Chevrolet carried Roberts, Sharpe, and Townsend. The Chevy apparently had carburetor problems and was forced to the side of the highway. Sharpe and Townsend were ordered to stay with Posey's car and service it. Roberts transferred to Barnette's car, joining Arledge, Jordan, Posey, and Snowden.\n\nPrice eventually caught the CORE station wagon heading west toward [[Union, Mississippi]], on state highway 492. Soon he stopped them and escorted the three civil right workers north on Highway 19, back in the direction of Philadelphia. The caravan turned west on County Road 515 (also known as Rock Cut Road), and stopped at the secluded intersection of County Road 515 and County Road 284 ({{coord|32|39|40.45|N|89|2|4.13|W}}). They were shot by Jordan and Roberts. Chaney was also beaten before his death.\n\n===Disposing of the evidence===\n[[File:Mississippi KKK Conspiracy Murders June 21 1964 CORE Ford Station Wagon Location On Logging Road.jpg|thumb|right|250px|The station wagon on an abandoned logging road along Highway 21]]\nAfter the three men were shot, they were quickly loaded into their Ford station wagon and transported to Burrage's Old Jolly Farm located along [[Mississippi Highway 21|Highway 21]], a few miles southwest of Philadelphia where an earthen dam for a farm pond was under construction.

One month later, government attorneys secured indictments against the conspirators from a federal grand jury in Jackson.  On February 24, 1965, however, Federal Judge [[William Harold Cox]], an ardent segregationist, threw out the indictments against all conspirators other than Rainey and Price on the ground that the other seventeen were not acting \"under color of state law.\"  In March, 1966, the United States Supreme Court overruled Cox and reinstated the indictments.  Defense attorneys then made the argument that the original indictments were flawed because the pool of jurors from which the grand jury was drawn contained insufficient numbers of minorities.

The victims were [[Andrew Goodman]] and [[Michael Schwerner|Michael \"Mickey\" Schwerner]] from [[New York City]], and [[James Chaney]] from [[Meridian, Mississippi]]. All three were associated with the [[Council of Federated Organizations]] (COFO) and its member organization the [[Congress of Racial Equality]] (CORE). They had been working with the [[Freedom Summer]] campaign by attempting to register African Americans in Mississippi to vote. This registration effort was a part of contesting over 70 years of laws and practices that supported a systematic policy of [[Disenfranchisement after the Reconstruction Era|disenfranchisement of potential black voters]] by several southern states that began in 1890.\n\nThe three men had traveled from Meridian, Mississippi, to the community of Longdale to talk with congregation members at a church that had been burned.

After the state government refused to prosecute, in 1967 the United States federal government charged 18 individuals with civil rights violations.

Bombings, murders, vandalism, and intimidation were tactics used by [[White supremacy|white supremacists]] in order to discourage black Mississippians and their Northern supporters. In 1961 [[Freedom Riders]], who challenged the segregation of interstate buses and related facilities, were attacked on their route. In September 1962, the [[Ole Miss riot of 1962|University of Mississippi riots]] had occurred in order to prevent [[James Meredith]] from enrolling at the school.\n\nThe Mississippi White Knights of the Ku Klux Klan, a [[Ku Klux Klan]] splinter group, was founded and led by [[Samuel Bowers]] of [[Laurel, Mississippi]]. As the summer of 1964 approached, white Mississippians prepared for what they perceived was an invasion from the north. College students had been recruited in order to aid local activists who were conducting grassroots community organizing, voter registration education and drives in the state.

This status quo had long been enforced by economic boycotts and violence.

Before his friend Lawrence A. Rainey was elected sheriff in 1963, [[Cecil Price|Cecil R.

The 26-year-old Price was the only person who witnessed the entire event. He arrested the three men, released them the night of the murders, and chased them down state highway 19 toward Meridian, eventually re-capturing them at the intersection near House, Mississippi. Price and the other nine men escorted them north along highway 19 to Rock Cut Road, where they forced a stop and murdered the three civil rights workers.\n\nKillen went to Meridian earlier that Sunday to organize and recruit men for the job to be carried out in Neshoba County.<ref name=organizejob>{{cite book |title=We Are Not Afraid|chapter=Rock Cut Road |author1=Seth Cagin |author2=Philip Dray |year=1988 |publisher =Bantam Books |page=278}}</ref> Before the men left for Philadelphia, Travis M. Barnette, 36, went to his Meridian home to take care of a sick family member. Barnette owned a Meridian garage and was a member of the White Knights. Alton W. Roberts, 26, was a [[dishonorably discharged]] U.S. Marine who worked as a salesman in Meridian. Roberts, standing at {{convert|6|ft|3|in|m|abbr=on}} and weighing in at {{convert|270|lbs|kg|abbr=on}}, was a formidable foe and renowned for his short temper. According to witnesses, Roberts shot both Goodman and Schwerner at point blank range. He also shot Chaney in the head after another accomplice, James Jordan, shot Chaney in the abdomen.  Roberts said \"Are you that nigger lover?\" to Schwerner, and shooting him after the latter responded, \"Sir, I know just how you feel.\" Jimmy K. Arledge, 27, and Jimmy Snowden, 31, were both Meridian commercial drivers. Arledge, a high school drop-out, and Snowden, a U.S. Army veteran, were present during the murders. After the second arrest by Price, Arledge would drive the CORE station wagon from state highway 492 to Rock Cut Road.\n\nJerry M. Sharpe, Billy W. Posey, and Jimmy L. Townsend were all from Philadelphia. Sharpe, 21, ran a pulp wood supply house. Posey, 28, a Williamsville, Mississippi automobile mechanic, owned a 1958 red and white Chevrolet; the car was considered fast and was chosen over Sharpe's. The youngest was Townsend, 17; he left high school in 1964 to work at Posey's [[Phillips 66]] garage. Horace D. Barnette, 25, was Travis' younger half-brother; he had a 1957 two-toned blue [[Ford Fairlane (Americas)|Ford Fairlane]] sedan.<ref name=\"akinsbusiness\"/> Horace Barnette's car is the one the group took after Posey's car broke down.

The workers arrived at Pilgrim's store, where they may have been inclined to stop and use the telephone, but the presence of a Mississippi Highway Safety patrol car, manned by Officer Wiggs and Poe, most likely dissuaded them. They continued south toward Meridian.\n[[File:Mississippi KKK Conspiracy Murders June 21 1964 CORE Ford Station Wagon Location.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Ford Station Wagon location near the Bogue Chitto River near Highway 21 ({{coord|32|52|54.15|N|88|56|16.87|W}})]]\nThe [[Lynching|lynch mob]] members, who were in Barnette's and Posey's cars, were drinking while arguing who would kill the three young men. Eventually Philadelphia Police Officer Burkes drove up to Horace D. Barnette's car and told the group: \"They're going on 19 toward Meridian. Follow them!\" After a quick rendezvous with Philadelphia police officer Richard Willis, Price was in pursuit of the three civil rights workers.\n\nPosey's Chevrolet carried Roberts, Sharpe, and Townsend. The Chevy apparently had carburetor problems and was forced to the side of the highway. Sharpe and Townsend were ordered to stay with Posey's car and service it. Roberts transferred to Barnette's car, joining Arledge, Jordan, Posey, and Snowden.\n\nPrice eventually caught the CORE station wagon heading west toward [[Union, Mississippi]], on state highway 492. Soon he stopped them and escorted the three civil right workers north on Highway 19, back in the direction of Philadelphia. The caravan turned west on County Road 515 (also known as Rock Cut Road), and stopped at the secluded intersection of County Road 515 and County Road 284 ({{coord|32|39|40.45|N|89|2|4.13|W}}).

Herman Tucker, a heavy machinery operator, was at the dam waiting for the lynch mob's arrival. Earlier in the day, Burrage, Posey, and Tucker had met at Posey's gasoline station or Burrage's garage to discuss these burial details, and Tucker most likely was the one who covered up the bodies using a bulldozer that he owned. An autopsy of Andrew Goodman, showing fragments of red clay in his lungs and grasped in his fists, suggests he was probably buried alive alongside the already dead Chaney and Schwerner.<ref>{{cite web|title=A Mississippi Freedom Summer Pilgrimage: An Atrocity We Must Never Forget|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/marian-wright-edelman/a-mississippi-freedom-sum_b_5622366.html|website=The Huffington Post|accessdate=2015-12-14}}</ref>\n\nAfter all three were buried, Price told the group:\n{{quote|Well, boys, you've done a good job.
