Marking the forthcoming 70th birthday (18 July 1988) of the imprisoned [[Internal resistance to South African apartheid|anti-apartheid revolutionary]] [[Nelson Mandela]], the concert was also referred to as Freedomfest, '''Free Nelson Mandela Concert''' and Mandela Day. In the United States, the [[Fox News|Fox television network]] heavily censored the political aspects of the concert.<ref name=\"autogenerated174\">T. V.

This was implicitly acknowledged by Nelson Mandela, himself, by his decision to participate in the second event.\"</ref><ref>Letter from Archbishop [[Trevor Huddleston]], President of the Anti-Apartheid Movement, 12 July 1995: \"The result of his efforts helped to generate the pressures which secured the release of Nelson Mandela.\"</ref><ref>ANC website message from Oliver Tambo: [http://www.anc.org.za/nelson/show.php?id=4566 \"...the worldwide campaign for the release of Nelson Mandela and political prisoners made a decisive contribution....One event in particular symbolised that campaign – the 'Nelson Mandela 70th Birthday Tribute'...The ANC owes an enormous debt of gratitude to the artists and performers and all those who made that event possible...]</ref>\n\nEighteen months after the event, with a release now thought to be approaching, Mandela asked for the organisers of the event to create a second concert as an official international reception at which, after 27 years in prison, he would address the world.  The second event, [[Nelson Mandela: An International Tribute for a Free South Africa]], was, like the first, conceived to be shown on television across the world and was broadcast from Wembley Stadium to more than 60 countries on 16 April 1990.\n\nThe first concert, according to [[Robin Denselow]], music critic and presenter of the BBC broadcast, writing in 1989,<ref>Denselow, Robin, ''When The Music's Over: The Story of Political Pop'', Faber and Faber, 1990 ({{ISBN|0-571-13906-X}}), p. 276.</ref> was the \"biggest and most spectacular pop-political event of all time, a more political version of Live Aid with the aim of raising consciousness rather than just money.\"\n\nThe organiser and risk-funder of the two events was producer and impresario Tony Hollingsworth. Hollingsworth also conceived the idea for the first event.<ref>Letter from [[Mike Terry]], Executive Secretary, Anti-Apartheid Movement, 18 January 2003: \"...he performed multiple roles of creator, risk taker, executive producer, producer and artists recruiter.  He never claimed such an array of titles nor pushed himself in front of the media preferring to let the media focus on the cause at hand.\"</ref><ref>Letter to Hollingsworth from AAM, signed by Archbishop Huddleston, Dr [[Allan Boesak]], [[Robert Hughes, Baron Hughes of Woodside|Robert Huges]] MP, [[Andimba Toivo ja Toivo]] and [[Oliver Tambo]], president of the African National Congress, 12 June 1988, the day after the first Mandela concert: \"On behalf of all of us who got the credit for the marvellous Anti Apartheid concert and all that will follow from it – a thousand thanks!\"</ref>\n\n==Starting point==\nHollingsworth developed the plan for the first Mandela concert after talking to singer [[Jerry Dammers]] of [[The Specials]] ska band, who had written the song ''Free Nelson Mandela'' in 1984 and founded the Artists Against Apartheid organisation the following year.  In early 1986, Hollingsworth contacted Dammers to say that the Greater London Council, for which Hollingsworth was producing a number of festivals and concerts, might be able to fund the AAA. The authority was due to be abolished at the end of March and had spare cash to give away.  But a grant turned out to be impossible because the AAA was not a legal entity and Dammers had no interest in making it one.\n\nHollingsworth told Dammers that he would put on an anti-apartheid concert if the singer could find a big name. Dammers did not phone back until June 1987, although in the summer of 1986 he had organised a free anti-apartheid concert, Freedom Beat, in London's Clapham Common attended by 200,000 people.<ref>[http://www.racismnoway.com.au/teaching-resources/factsheets/62.html Anti-racism education for Australian schools]</ref>\n\nDammers told Hollingsworth that he had received a letter from [[Simple Minds]], the Glasgow rock band, agreeing to perform at an event which Hollingsworth had suggested for the previous year. The two agreed to go to Edinburgh, where Simple Minds were performing, to talk about a deal for a new event.\n\nHollingsworth had in mind a major event, a birthday tribute for Mandela, who would be 70 the following year. The event would seek worldwide television and would call for his release – the first step in ending apartheid.  Simple Minds was interested in the proposal but only if Hollingsworth brought in another top group.\n\n==Persuading the Anti-Apartheid Movement==\nAt the same time, Hollingsworth started what turned out to be a series of meetings with Mike Terry, head of the Anti-Apartheid Movement in London. Also of note was the work of [[Robert Hughes, Baron Hughes of Woodside]], who led the AAM (Anti-Apartheid Movement) at the time these concerts were organised.<ref>[[Robert Hughes, Baron Hughes of Woodside]]</ref>\nIf the concert was to be successful, it was important to win the support of the movement and, with it, the implicit support of Mandela.  But Terry and his senior officials firmly resisted Hollingsworth's proposal, insisting on three conditions, based on the policies of the African National Congress.\n\nFirst, the concert must focus on all political prisoners in South Africa, not just Mandela.  Mandela had himself told the ANC that he did not wish to be singled out from other prisoners in the organisation's campaigning.  Second, the event must campaign against apartheid as a whole and this was to be in its title.  Third, it must call for sanctions against South Africa.\n\nHollingsworth argued that the concert could not be effective under those terms. They would not work for an event that was intended for the mass media across the world, including in countries where there might be little knowledge of Mandela, let alone support for him. The event should not be \"angry\", but a \"positive\" birthday tribute, calling only for Mandela to be freed.\n\nMany broadcasters, Hollingsworth argued, would not televise a Mandela concert if it followed the AAM and ANC campaign policies.  They would regard it as a political event.  Other broadcasters would provide only limited airtime.  But a positive birthday tribute would conform to the broadcasters' entertainment mandate and there would be a good chance they would show the full day's event.\nHollingsworth was not seeking ANC backing because that would have put off broadcasters.  He wanted the AAM's backing but, for similar reasons, did not want the movement's name on the event.\n\nTerry was the first to come round to Hollingsworth's view, but needed some time before persuading the rest of his team.  On the other hand, he quickly won the approval of [[Trevor Huddleston|Archbishop Trevor Huddleston]], the AAM president and a former priest in southern Africa.\n\n== Signing up first artists ==\nBy the time that the Anti-Apartheid Movement had agreed to support the concert, Hollingsworth had booked Wembley Stadium for the following June and had approached several artists in addition to Simple Minds. Few were saying a definite no, but hardly anyone would commit.\n\nHollingsworth wanted [[Dire Straits]], one of the largest acts in the world and the kind of act that was needed if broadcasters across the world were to sign up for the event, to head the bill. The group took the same line as Simple Minds. The band's manager [[Ed Bicknell]] said that Dire Straits would perform if other top acts also agreed, but Hollingsworth was not to mention Dire Straits in persuading the other acts.\n\nHollingsworth signed up other big names, albeit on a provisional basis, put them in touch with one another and finally they all, including Dire Straits, agreed to perform.  With clearly enough talent on board, Hollingsworth announced the bill in March, three months before the 11 June event. The list included Dire Straits, Simple Minds, [[George Michael]], [[Whitney Houston]], [[UB40]], [[Aswad (band)|Aswad]], [[Sly and Robbie]], [[Bee Gees]], [[Miriam Makeba]] and [[Hugh Masekela]]. The announcement of the list made it easier to bring in further artists, including the [[Eurythmics]] who had earlier refused three times, but other big names also.\n\nThere were some difficulties. Bicknell, for instance, was shocked when Hollingsworth told him there was one condition to Dire Straits playing. The band must rehearse for the event because it had not been on tour for some time and had even disbanded, albeit temporarily. Hollingsworth, in fact, told most of the artists they must rehearse, offering to pay for all rehearsal costs. Dire Straits, like the others, complied. In the event, the band had to bring in a guest guitarist to replace [[Jack Sonni]], who had just become the father of twin girls. The new man was [[Eric Clapton]].\n\nA week after the first bill was announced, Simple Minds threatened to quit, arguing that there was not enough grit in it: Whitney Houston and George Michael, for instance, should not be there. Hollingsworth argued that there was plenty of grit but that Whitney Houston and George Michael were needed to broaden the audience to include people who were not so likely to know about Mandela and apartheid. Simple Minds accepted the argument.\n\n==Harry Belafonte, Sting and Stevie Wonder==\n'''[[Harry Belafonte]]''': Hollingsworth went to New York to ask Harry Belafonte to give the opening address of the concert.  Belafonte made it clear he was upset that, with so many musicians appearing, he was being asked only to talk.\n\nHollingsworth told him the audience was not the right culture for him. He feared that Belafonte's singing would turn the clock back 30 years and would lose much of the television audience across the world. He was already worried about losing the audience as a result of using African singers and dancers whom many people would not have heard of. On the other hand, Belafonte, as a highly respected, internationally known personality, would be an effective speaker. Belafonte told him he would think about it, but Hollingsworth should also think about him performing.\n\nThe two spoke a week later, with each taking much the same position, although Hollingsworth added that Belafonte could sing if he could get a category-A artist, such as [[Bruce Springsteen]] or [[Mick Jagger]] or [[Elton John]], to sing with him. Belafonte did not get any of those, but came back with a list which Hollingsworth said was not good enough. Eventually, Belafonte agreed just to give the opening speech.\n\n'''[[Sting (musician)|Sting]]''': Hollingsworth went to great lengths to get Sting to perform at the concert. The singer was associated with human rights issues, partly as a result of his song ''[[They Dance Alone]]'' about the Chilean dictator [[Augusto Pinochet]], and was at the height of his popularity.  Sting's manager [[Miles Copeland III|Miles Copeland]], however, refused even to put the proposition to the singer because he would be on a world tour at the time and the Wembley concert would not fit in. The final tour schedule showed Sting due to perform in Berlin the night before Wembley and elsewhere in Europe on the evening of the Wembley concert.\n\nSeveral weeks before Wembley, Hollingsworth went to Switzerland where Sting was playing and booked himself into the same hotel.  He got reception to put him through to Sting (using the singer's actual name, Gordon Sumner), told Sting that his management had refused to let him talk to the singer, and asked to meet him. Sting told him to come round to his room.\n\nHollingsworth told Sting that he would fly the singer and his band to London on a private plane after his Friday evening Berlin concert, drive him to Wembley in the morning where an identical set of equipment would be set up on stage for him. Sting would then do a sound check and open the show a few minutes after mid-day, the first act of the concert (after an opening speech and a set of South African show dancers). As soon as he had done his half-hour slot, he would be driven to the airport and put on the private plane taking him back to the continent. Sting agreed.\n\nCopeland was furious about the agreement and shocked that Sting would open the show rather than be one of the closing acts. But the event was being organised not as a live concert but as a television show and that, according to Hollingsworth, meant a top act at the beginning when \"the largest audience tunes in to see how it's going to be\". At least one big act was planned for each hour of the 11-hour day in a bid to keep the audience.\n\n'''[[Stevie Wonder]]''': One of the first artists that Hollingsworth tried to sign up was Stevie Wonder. He could never get through to the singer, though he phoned him every Friday at his studio. Senior members of the team told him each time that the matter was \"under consideration\".\n\nOn the Wednesday before the concert, Wonder phoned back, asking whether there was still space for him. Hollingsworth told him there was a 25-minute slot – time that had originally been kept open for [[Prince (musician)|Prince]] and [[Bono]] to sing a duet together but which the two singers turned down. Wonder agreed the booking. This was never announced but was to be a surprise for the audience. In the event, the singer caused a major backstage drama when the equipment used to play his pre-recorded music was lost.  He refused to play and walked out of the stadium – though he returned later using Whitney Houston's instruments.\n\n==Broadcast politics==\nOnce the first set of artists had signed up, broadcasters were approached, starting with the BBC.  [[Alan Yentob]], recently appointed controller of [[BBC2]], said that he would provide five hours of airtime – and more if the bill improved. After several more top artists were added, the BBC agreed to televise the whole show.\n\nBefore the concert, 24 Conservative MPs put down a House of Commons motion, criticising the BBC for giving \"publicity to a movement that encourages the African National Congress in its terrorist activities\".<ref>Denselow (1990), ''When The Music's Over'', p. 279.</ref>  However, no appeal was either planned or made. Further, the artists’ contracts – which in many cases were signed backstage at Wembley – laid down that no proceeds from the income of the event should go \"towards the purchase of or in any other connection with armaments\".\n\nWhat problems there were came from the other side. Both the Anti-Apartheid Movement and Hollingsworth received bomb threats warning them not to go ahead with the event. Nearer the event, there was a threat to blow up the power station distributing electricity to Wembley.\n\nWith the BBC on board, it was easier to persuade other broadcasters to buy the rights for the concert. The show was in most cases sold to the entertainment divisions of broadcasters as a birthday tribute that would not be political. As a result, they could agree to show the event without referring the question upwards or to the news or current-affairs divisions. According to Hollingsworth, once they had agreed to show the concert, the news divisions would have to stop referring to Mandela as a terrorist leader, thereby helping to ensure that Mandela was looked upon in a more favourable light. This was said to be a campaign objective which was beginning to be achieved by March.\n\nEven so, given the subject matter, the event was bound to be political in a broad sense. Thus, a week before the event, the Chicago Sun-Times said that the concert would have \"the most overtly political theme since the 1960s...It's a confrontational political event aimed at the government of South Africa and its practice of apartheid\".<ref>John Swenson, \"Big pop concert will seek Nelson Mandela's release\", ''Chicago Sun-Times'', 4 June 1988.</ref>\n\nBroadcasters were also told that the concert would use two stages, enabling acts to follow each other without a break, with top acts on the main stage and lesser-known groups on the second. There would therefore be no need for broadcasters to add material between events. The reasoning was that, first, the concert would look like a television show without awkward gaps encouraging audiences to switch off; and, second, broadcasters would be less likely to impose their own narrative on the event. The use of film stars to introduce major acts also helped achieve these objectives. Some broadcasters did send presenters to carry out backstage interviews for the presumed gaps but stopped doing so after a couple of hours.\n\nMost broadcasters showed the event live. Others, particularly in the Americas, showed it delayed because of the time difference. Most gave more or less full coverage.\n\nIn the US, the [[Fox Television]] network showed only six hours in what was referred to as a \"significantly de-radicalised version\".<ref name=\"autogenerated174\"/> A number of artists had their songs or speeches cut. One US newspaper objected that Fox \"cut out some of the most passionate – and especially most political – moments of the day\".<ref name=\"morse1988\"/> [[Steven Van Zandt]] was appalled when he saw a recording of the Fox broadcast on his return to the US. He complained to the press, describing it as \"a totally Orwellian experience\".<ref name=\"shirley1992\"/> His own contribution, including a strident rendering of the song, ''[[Sun City (song)|Sun City]]'', was one of those that were cut. Fox was worried about its sponsors and advertisers, particularly [[Coca-Cola]] which had booked six advertising spots for each hour.\n\nWhitney Houston, who was contracted to make advertisements for Coca-Cola, did her act in front of a black backdrop instead of the usual picture of Nelson Mandela. But, according to Hollingsworth, this was nothing to do with censorship but the result of an electricity generator failing.\n\nFox also refused to use the concert title, Nelson Mandela 70th Birthday Tribute. Instead, it billed the show as Freedomfest, objecting to the pleas of the organisers to at least add \"for Nelson Mandela\".\n\nA further issue was highlighted by film actress [[Whoopi Goldberg]] when she came on stage to introduce one of the acts, saying that she had been told to say nothing political. The request did not come from the concert organisers but from the Fox TV producer at Wembley who, unbeknown to the organisers, told the Hollywood film stars to avoid saying anything political because an election was coming up in the States. After the event, the producer – in charge of his own editing team for the US broadcast – took out a full-page advertisement in a US trade magazine thanking American artists for participating in his show.\n\nThe producer had been flown in a week before the Wembley concert to replace Fox's original choice who had been working on the production for three weeks but was thought by the network to have become infected by the political ethos of the concert organisation.\n\n==On-stage politics==\nThere were supposed to be no political speeches at the event except for the message that Nelson Mandela should be freed – coming from Harry Belafonte in his opening speech, from the film stars and musicians introducing the acts or the next piece of music and from the slogans around the stage. The principle – aimed at ensuring that broadcasters would, first, buy the television rights and, second, continue to show the proceedings – was more or less followed.\n\nEarly on, the organisers stopped an insistent [[Jesse Jackson]], the black American politician, from going on stage to make a speech. To have agreed to the request would have made it very difficult to say no to others. Jackson was, instead, shepherded to the Royal Box, joining Labour Party leader [[Neil Kinnock]] and Liberal leader [[David Steel]] along with a number of actors and musicians.\n\nNonetheless, the posters, the political references from the actors and musicians, the music itself, the way the singers worked the audience and the audience response almost certainly got across a wider political message about apartheid.\nOne or two artists took a harder line. [[Steven Van Zandt]], for instance, in the run-up to singing Sun City with Simple Minds, declared that \"we the people will no longer tolerate the terrorism of the government of South Africa\" and that \"we will no longer do business with those who do business with the terrorist government of South Africa\".\n\n==Stevie Wonder walks out==\n[[Stevie Wonder]] landed in the United Kingdom on the Saturday morning of the concert and went straight to Wembley Stadium, where a room was prepared for him and his band to warm up. He was to appear in the evening after [[UB40]]. His appearance had not been announced.\n\nUB40 were finishing their set on the main stage, and Wonder's equipment was set up, plugged in and ready to be rolled on after a 10-minute act on a side stage. He was about to walk up the ramp to the stage when it was discovered that the hard disc of his [[synclavier]], carrying all 25 minutes of synthesised music for his act, was missing. He said he could not play without it, turned round, walked down the ramp crying, with his band and other members of his entourage following him, and out of the stadium.\n\nThere was an urgent need to fill the gap he had left and [[Tracy Chapman]], who had already performed her act, agreed to appear again.  The two appearances shot her to stardom, with two songs from her recently released first album, \"[[Fast Car]]\" and \"[[Talkin' 'Bout a Revolution]]\". Before the concert, she had sold about 250,000 albums. In the following two weeks, she was said to have sold two million.\n\nWonder returned to the stadium, but turned down the request to use the same equipment as the present act on the main stage, [[Whitney Houston]]. Other members of the band said they would use other people's equipment. Finally, with time running out, Wonder agreed.\n\nWhitney finished with three encores and the next act, [[Salt-N-Pepa]] (SNP), started on the side stage using 3 minutes and 30 seconds of pre-approved stage time. Following SNP's performance, there was no announcement, no sound from the main stage until, out of the darkness, came the opening lines of \"[[I Just Called to Say I Love You]]\" and a huge roar from the audience. The lights came on and Wonder went into the rest of the set. With the loss of the programmed hard disc, he shouted the change of notes to the band.\n\n==Resonant music==\nThe concert included several well-known protest songs and others which received an added resonance from the occasion. The songs included:\n*''[[Free Nelson Mandela]]'' by '''Jerry Dammers'''\n*''[[Biko (song)|Biko]]'' by '''Peter Gabriel'''\n*''[[They Dance Alone]]'' by '''Sting'''\n*''[[Sun City (song)|Sun City]]'' by '''Steven Van Zandt'''\n*''[[Mandela Day (song)|Mandela Day]]'' by '''Simple Minds'''\n*''[[I Just Called to Say I Love You]]'' by '''Stevie Wonder'''\n*''[[Amazing Grace]]'', sung by '''Jessye Norman'''\n\n==Funding and organisation==\nThe initial funding for Nelson Mandela 70th Birthday Tribute came from Hollingsworth and, specifically, from the money that he had put into the production company, Elephant House, set up with television producer Neville Bolt. But the money amounted only \"to 75 per cent of what was needed as a minimum\". Funding to help pay the deposit on Wembley Stadium came from a trade-union loan organised by the Anti Apartheid Movement.\n\nWembley agreed to the unusual procedure of handing over ticket revenue as soon as it came in, and some television companies agreed to pay rights fees earlier than usual (although the BBC did not pay cash but provided facilities).\n\nAlthough the aim of the day was to raise consciousness about South Africa and Mandela, the event also made a profit of $5 million.  One half went to the AAM to cover its costs, including a protest march the following day; and one half to seven charities named by [[Trevor Huddleston|Archbishop Huddleston]] on condition that none of the money went towards the purchase of armaments.\n\nThe seven charities were: [[Oxfam]], [[Christian Aid]], [[War on Want]], [[Catholic Fund for Overseas Development]], [[Save the Children]], Bishop Ambrose Reeves Trust and the International Defence and Aid Fund.  With the charities in mind, a company, Freedom Productions, was set up to which the artists rights were assigned.\n\nRights in the event are held by [[Tribute Inspirations|Tribute Inspirations Limited]].\n\n==Postscript==\nThe estimated audience for the Mandela 70th Birthday Tribute of 600 million in 67 countries was arguably an underestimate in that several broadcasters in Africa were given a free licence. However, the apartheid government did not allow the event to be broadcast in South Africa. But news of the event and its popularity reached Mandela and other political prisoners.  In time, the strong ripple effect is thought to have increased pressure on the government to release Mandela, and it became increasingly likely that he would be released, albeit 20 months after the concert and 27 years after he was put in prison.\n\nShortly before Mandela's release, Hollingsworth, Terry and Mandela's lawyer sat down in London to plan another broadcast event to celebrate Mandela's release and to call for the end of Apartheid.\n\n==Performers and speakers==\n{{columns-list|3|\nIn order of appearance:\n*The [[Farafina]] Drummers\n*[[Sting (musician)|Sting]] (introduced by [[Harry Belafonte]]) – \"[[If You Love Somebody Set Them Free]]\", \"[[They Dance Alone]]\", \"[[Every Breath You Take]]\", \"[[Message in a Bottle (song)|Message in a Bottle]]\"\n*[[George Michael]] (introduced by [[Lenny Henry]]) – \"Village Ghetto Land\", \"If You Were My Woman\", \"[[Sexual Healing]]\"\n*Sir [[Richard Attenborough]] -

Sedan's effects were similar to shot \"George\" of [[Operation Tumbler–Snapper]], detonated on June 1, 1952, which also contributed about 7% to the total radioactive fallout.

Proposed applications included the creation of harbors, canals, open pit mines, railroad and highway cuts through mountainous terrain and the construction of dams. Assessment of the full effects of the Sedan shot showed that the radioactive fallout from such uses would be extensive.

As a practical matter, the summit was also conceived as an opportunity for its members to give each other mutual encouragement in the face of difficult economic decisions.<ref name=\"reinalda205\"/>\n\nThe overall theme of the summit was ways to reduce poverty. Topics discussed at the meeting included an evaluation of the [[Enhanced HIPC Initiative]] which involved [[Debt relief|debt forgiveness]] to [[Heavily Indebted Poor Countries]], the [[Global Health Fund]], the [[global digital divide]], the [[Environmentalism|environment]] and [[food security]]. Although the main summit was from July 20 to the 22nd, the summit was preceded by a meeting of the G8 [[foreign minister]]s on the 18th and 19th.<ref>[http://www.g8italia.it/_en/docs/KJIHGZ31.htm] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070414225454/http://www.g8italia.it/_en/docs/KJIHGZ31.htm |date=April 14, 2007 }}</ref>\n\nThe summit was overshadowed by riots in the city after a crackdown by police targeting [[anti-globalisation]] groups and the death of a 23-year-old [[Carlo Giuliani]], leading some to talk of a deliberately followed [[strategy of tension]].\n\nBefore the summit, significant controversies and ridicule among local people and media focused on the security plans (such as fences going through streets and inside houses) and image provisions (such as the prohibition to dry up the [[laundry]]<ref>{{cite news|title=Genoese Laundry Deemed Unsuitable For G8 Leaders|url=http://www.shortnews.com/start.cfm?id=8326|date=2001-07-17|publisher=[[Reuters]]}}</ref>).\n\n==Citizens' responses and authorities' counter-responses==\n\n=== Protests ===\n[[File:Genova-G8 2001-Incidenti a Corso Torino.jpg|thumbnail|right|Protesters burn a Carabinieri vehicle.]] \nThe Genoa [[Group of Eight]] Summit protest, from July 18 to July 22, 2001, was a dramatic [[protest]], drawing an estimated 200,000 demonstrators. Dozens were hospitalized following clashes with police and night raids by security forces on two schools housing activists and independent journalists. People taken into custody after the raids have alleged severe abuse at the hands of police.\n\nDemonstrators accused the police of brutality and denying them their right to non-violent protest. They believe that G8 summits are non-legitimate attempts by eight of the world's most powerful governments to set the rules for the planet at large. Police and many politicians argued that attempting to blockade a meeting is in itself a violent event and an attempt to impede the workings of democratically elected governments. {{citation needed|reason=The Italian government led by Premier [[Silvio Berlusconi]] insisted that police used the minimum amount of force necessary to achieve their goals. It claimed that the protesters' claims were exaggerated|date=October 2015}}.\n\nThe G8 meeting was held inside a \"Red Zone\" in the center of town that had been declared off-limits for non-residents and surrounded by a barricade, leaving protesters no chance to communicate with summit delegates. Fears of a terrorist attack at the time had also led to an [[air exclusion zone]] around the city, as well as the stationing of [[anti-aircraft missile]]s.  Only one activist, Valérie Vie, secretary of a French branch of [[ATTAC]], managed to publicly breach the Red Zone barrier, but was immediately arrested by police agents.  There were also several border [[riot]]s ahead of the summit, as police attempted to prevent suspected activists from entering Italy.  The Italian government suspended [[freedom of movement]] entitled by the [[Schengen treaty]] for the duration of the G8 summit, in order to monitor the movement of the many protesters arriving from across the [[European Union]].\n\n===Injuries and deaths===\n\nMany demonstrators were injured and dozens more arrested over the course of the event. Most of those 329 arrested were charged with [[criminal conspiracy]] to commit destruction; but they were in most part released shortly thereafter because judges declared the charges invalid. Police continued to raid social centers, media centers, union buildings and legal offices across Italy after the summit as part of ongoing investigations. Over 400 protesters and about 100 among security forces were injured during the clashes.\n\nOn July 20, a 23-year-old activist [[Carlo Giuliani]] of Genoa, was shot dead by Mario Placanica, a [[Carabiniere]], during clashes with police. Images show Giuliani throwing a fire extinguisher at the carabiniere's vehicle before he was shot and then run over twice by the Land Rover. Placanica was acquitted from any wrongdoing, as judges determined he fired in self-defence and to the sky but a flying stone deflected the bullet and killed Giuliani.<ref>[http://ricerca.repubblica.it/repubblica/archivio/repubblica/2006/11/30/g8-festa-in-caserma-dopo-il-morto.html \"G8, festa in caserma dopo il morto,\"] ''Repubblica.''

June 21, 2001.{{it icon}}</ref>\n\n===Charges===\nIn December 2007, 25 demonstrators were condemned for property damage and looting.\n \nNumerous police officers and local and national officials have been ordered to stand trial in connection with the event. In one trial, 28 police officials are standing trial on charges related to the two night raids, charged with conspiracy to pervert the course of justice, use of excessive force and planting evidence. In other proceedings, 45 state officials, including prison guards, police and medics, are being tried for abusing detainees in their custody at [[Bolzaneto]] who were arrested during the raid. Detainees reported being spat at, verbally and physically humiliated, and threatened with rape.<ref>{{cite news | title = Trial forces Italy to relive shocking police brutality | url = http://news.independent.co.uk/europe/article318852.ece | publisher = The Independent |date= 2005-10-12 | accessdate = 2007-08-05 | location=London | first=Peter | last=Popham}}</ref>\n\nPolice conducted nighttime raids upon centers housing protesters and campsites, most notably the [[2001 raid on the Diaz school|attacks on the Diaz-Pascoli and Diaz-Pertini schools]] shortly after midnight on July 21. These were being used as sleeping quarters, and had also been set up as centers for those providing media, medical, and legal support work. Police baton attacks left three activists, including British journalist Mark Covell, in comas. At least one person has suffered brain damage, while another had both jaws and fourteen teeth broken. In total, over 60 were severely injured and a [[parliamentary inquiry]] was launched.<ref>Carroll, Rory.

In May, 2003, Judge Anna Ivaldi concluded that they had put up no resistance whatsoever to the police and all charges were dropped against them. During the inquiry, Pietro Troiani, the deputy police chief in Genoa, admitted to being involved in the planting of Molotov cocktails in order to justify the Diaz School raids, as well as faking the stabbing of a police officer to frame activists.<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/2636647.stm \"Genoa police 'admit fabrication',\"] BBC.

Twenty-five of the 27 original defendants were finally convicted.

Smith (astronaut)|Michael J.

The spacecraft disintegrated over the [[Atlantic Ocean]], off the coast of [[Cape Canaveral, Florida|Cape Canaveral]], [[Florida]], at 11:39 [[North American Eastern Time Zone|EST]] (16:39 [[Coordinated Universal Time|UTC]]). The disintegration of the vehicle began after an [[O-ring]] seal in its right [[Space Shuttle Solid Rocket Booster|solid rocket booster]] (SRB) failed at liftoff. The O-ring was not designed to fly under unusually cold conditions as in this launch. Its failure caused a breach in the SRB joint it sealed, allowing pressurized burning gas from within the solid rocket motor to reach the outside and impinge upon the adjacent SRB aft field joint attachment hardware and [[Space Shuttle external tank|external fuel tank]]. This led to the separation of the right-hand SRB's aft field joint attachment and the [[Structural integrity and failure|structural failure]] of the external tank. [[aerodynamics|Aerodynamic]] forces broke up the orbiter.\n\nThe crew compartment and many other vehicle fragments were eventually recovered from the ocean floor after a lengthy search and recovery operation. The exact timing of the death of the crew is unknown; several crew members are known to have survived the initial breakup of the spacecraft. The shuttle had no escape system,<ref>The first two Space Shuttle orbiters, ''Enterprise'' and ''Columbia'', originally had [[Space Shuttle abort modes#Ejection seat|ejection seats]] installed in the flight deck for the pilot and co-pilot in the initial test missions. Because of the configuration of the crew cabin, such seats could not be used for the remaining six passenger positions.

For each flight, the four resulting segments were then assembled in the [[Vehicle Assembly Building]] at [[Kennedy Space Center]] (KSC), with three field joints.  The factory joints were sealed with asbestos-silica insulation applied over the joint, while each field joint was sealed with two rubber O-rings. (After the destruction of ''Challenger'', the number of O-rings per field joint was increased to three.)<ref>{{cite web|title=Solid Rocket Motor Joint Reliability|url=http://engineer.jpl.nasa.gov/practices/1257.pdf|publisher=NASA Engineering}}</ref> The seals of all of the SRB joints were required to contain the hot, high-pressure gases produced by the burning solid propellant inside, thus forcing them out of the nozzle at the aft end of each rocket.\n\nDuring the [[Space Shuttle design process]], a [[McDonnell Douglas]] report in September 1971 discussed the safety record of solid rockets. While a safe abort was possible after most types of failures, one was especially dangerous: a burnthrough by hot gases of the rocket's casing. The report stated that \"if burnthrough occurs adjacent to [liquid hydrogen/oxygen] tank or orbiter, timely sensing may not be feasible and abort not possible\", accurately foreshadowing the ''Challenger'' accident.<ref name=\"heppenheimer1998\">{{cite book | title=The Space Shuttle Decision | publisher=NASA publication SP-4221 | author=Heppenheimer, T.

As originally designed by Thiokol, the O-ring joints in the SRBs were supposed to close more tightly due to forces generated at ignition, but a 1977 test showed that when pressurized water was used to simulate the effects of booster combustion, the metal parts bent away from each other, opening a gap through which gases could leak. This phenomenon, known as \"joint rotation,\" caused a momentary drop in air pressure. This made it possible for combustion gases to erode the O-rings. In the event of widespread erosion, a flame path could develop, causing the joint to burst—which would have destroyed the booster and the shuttle.<ref>McConnell, Malcolm. ''Challenger: A Major Malfunction,'' p. 118.</ref>\n\nEngineers at the [[Marshall Space Flight Center]] wrote to the manager of the Solid Rocket Booster project, George Hardy, on several occasions suggesting that Thiokol's field joint design was unacceptable. For example, one engineer suggested that joint rotation would render the secondary O-ring useless, but Hardy did not forward these memos to Thiokol, and the field joints were accepted for flight in 1980.<ref name=\"Rogers_vol6\">{{cite web |author=Rogers Commission |title=Report of the Presidential Commission on the Space Shuttle Challenger Accident, Chapter VI: An Accident Rooted in History |date=June 6, 1986 |url=https://history.nasa.gov/rogersrep/v1ch6.htm }}</ref>\n\nEvidence of serious O-ring erosion was present as early as the second space shuttle mission, [[STS-2]], which was flown by ''Columbia.'' Contrary to NASA regulations, the Marshall Center did not report this problem to senior management at NASA, but opted to keep the problem within their reporting channels with Thiokol. Even after the O-rings were redesignated as \"Criticality 1\"—meaning that their failure would result in the destruction of the Orbiter—no one at Marshall suggested that the shuttles be grounded until the flaw could be fixed.<ref name=\"Rogers_vol6\" />\n\nAfter the 1984 launch of [[STS-41-D]], flown by ''Discovery'', the first occurrence of hot gas \"blow-by\" was discovered beyond the primary O-ring. In the post-flight analysis, [[Thiokol]] engineers found that the amount of blow-by was relatively small and had not impinged upon the secondary O-ring, and concluded that for future flights, the damage was an acceptable risk. However, after the ''Challenger'' disaster, [[Thiokol]] engineer Brian Russell identified this event as the first \"big red flag\" regarding O-ring safety.<ref>{{cite book|last=Vaughan|first=Diane|title=The Challenger launch decision: risky technology, culture, and deviance at NASA|year=1996|publisher=University Of Chicago Press|isbn=978-0-226-85175-4|pages=143–44|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vpoc-vWvF_IC&pg=PA490&dq=sts-9#v=onepage&q=sts-9&f=false}}</ref>\n\nBy 1985, with seven of nine shuttle launches that year using boosters displaying O-ring erosion and/or hot gas blow-by,<ref>{{cite book|last=Vaughan|first=Diane|title=The Challenger launch decision: risky technology, culture, and deviance at NASA|year=1996|publisher=University Of Chicago Press|isbn=978-0-226-85175-4|page=153|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vpoc-vWvF_IC&pg=PA490&dq=sts-9#v=onepage&q=sts-9&f=false}}</ref> Marshall and Thiokol realized that they had a potentially catastrophic problem on their hands.

The primary O-ring of the left nozzle had been eroded so extensively that it had failed to seal, and for the first time hot gases had eroded the secondary O-ring.<ref>{{cite book|last=Vaughan|first=Diane|title=The Challenger launch decision: risky technology, culture, and deviance at NASA|year=1996|publisher=University Of Chicago Press|isbn=978-0-226-85175-4|page=162|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vpoc-vWvF_IC&pg=PA490&dq=sts-9#v=onepage&q=sts-9&f=false}}</ref> They began the process of redesigning the joint with three inches (76&nbsp;mm) of additional steel around the tang. This tang would grip the inner face of the joint and prevent it from rotating. They did not call for a halt to shuttle flights until the joints could be redesigned, but rather treated the problem as an acceptable flight risk. For example, Lawrence Mulloy, Marshall's manager for the SRB project since 1982, issued and waived launch constraints for six consecutive flights. Thiokol even went as far as to persuade NASA to declare the O-ring problem \"closed\".<ref name=\"Rogers_vol6\" /> [[Donald Kutyna]], a member of the [[Rogers Commission]], later likened this situation to an airline permitting one of its planes to continue to fly despite evidence that one of its wings was about to fall off.\n\n==Pre-launch conditions==\n\n===Delays===\n''Challenger'' was originally set to launch from [[Kennedy Space Center|KSC]] in Florida at 14:42 Eastern Standard Time (EST) on January 22, 1986.

The launch was then rescheduled to January 25 due to [[storm|bad weather]] at the [[Space Shuttle abort modes#Transoceanic Abort Landing .28TAL.29|Transoceanic Abort Landing (TAL)]] site in [[Dakar]], Senegal. NASA decided to use [[Casablanca]] as the TAL site, but because it was not equipped for night landings, the launch had to be moved to the morning ([[North American Eastern Time Zone|Florida time]]).

Bob Ebeling in October 1985 wrote a memo—titled \"Help!\" so others would read it—of concerns regarding low temperatures and O-rings. After the weather forecast, NASA personnel remembered Thiokol's warnings and contacted the company. When a Thiokol manager asked Ebeling about the possibility of a launch at 18 degrees, he answered \"[W]e're only qualified to 40 degrees ...'what business does anyone even have thinking about 18 degrees, we're in no-man's land.'\" After his team agreed that a launch risked disaster, Thiokol immediately called NASA recommending a postponement until temperatures rose in the afternoon. NASA manager Jud Lovingood responded that Thiokol could not make the recommendation without providing a safe temperature. The company prepared for a teleconference two hours later during which it would have to justify a no-launch recommendation.<ref name=bergin20070128>{{cite web | author=Chris Bergin| title=Remembering the mistakes of Challenger | url=http://www.nasaspaceflight.com/2007/01/remembering-the-mistakes-of-challenger/ | work=nasaspaceflight.com | date=January 28, 2007 | accessdate=August 5, 2011}}</ref>{{r|berkes20120206}}\n\nAt the teleconference on the evening of January 27, Thiokol engineers and managers discussed the weather conditions with NASA managers from Kennedy Space Center and Marshall Space Flight Center. Several engineers (most notably Ebeling and [[Roger Boisjoly]]) reiterated their concerns about the effect of low temperatures on the resilience of the rubber O-rings that sealed the joints of the SRBs, and recommended a launch postponement.{{r|berkes20120206}} They argued that they did not have enough data to determine whether the joints would properly seal if the O-rings were colder than {{convert|12|C|F}}. This was an important consideration, since the SRB O-rings had been designated as a \"Criticality 1\" component, meaning that there was no backup if both the primary and secondary O-rings failed, and their failure could destroy the Orbiter and kill its crew.\n\nThiokol management initially supported its engineers' recommendation to postpone the launch, but NASA staff opposed a delay. During the conference call, Hardy told Thiokol, \"I am appalled. I am appalled by your recommendation.\" Mulloy said, \"My God, Thiokol, when do you want me to launch—next April?\"{{r|berkes20120206}} NASA believed that Thiokol's hastily prepared presentation's quality was too poor to support such a statement on flight safety.{{r|bergin20070128}} One argument by NASA personnel contesting Thiokol's concerns was that if the primary O-ring failed, the secondary O-ring would still seal. This was unproven, and was in any case an argument that did not apply to a \"Criticality 1\" component. As astronaut [[Sally Ride]] stated when questioning NASA managers before the Rogers Commission, it is forbidden to rely on a backup for a \"Criticality 1\" component.\n\nNASA claimed that it did not know of Thiokol's earlier concerns about the effects of the cold on the O-rings, and did not understand that [[Rockwell International]], the shuttle's prime contractor, viewed the large amount of ice present on the pad as a constraint to launch. For reasons that are unclear, Thiokol management reversed itself and recommended that the launch proceed as scheduled;{{r|berkes20120206}}<ref name=\"rogers 5\">{{cite book| author=Rogers Commission | title=Report of the Presidential Commission on the Space Shuttle Challenger Accident|chapter= Chapter V: The Contributing Cause of The Accident | date=June 6, 1986| url=https://history.nasa.gov/rogersrep/v1ch5.htm |accessdate=July 12, 2011}}</ref> NASA did not ask why.{{r|bergin20070128}} Ebeling told his wife that night that ''Challenger'' would blow up.<ref>{{cite web | author=Ware, Doug G. | title = Engineer who warned of 1986 Challenger disaster still racked with guilt, three decades on | date=January 28, 2016 | publisher=United Press International | url = http://www.upi.com/Top_News/US/2016/01/28/Engineer-who-warned-of-1986-Challenger-disaster-still-racked-with-guilt-three-decades-on/4891454032643/ | accessdate=January 28, 2016}}</ref>\n\nKen Iliff, a former NASA Chief Scientist who had worked on the Space Shuttle Program since its first mission (and the X-15 program before that) stated in 2004, \"Violating a couple of mission rules was the primary cause of the ''Challenger'' accident.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=https://ntrs.nasa.gov/search.jsp?R=20040077335|title=NASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS): From Runway to Orbit, Reflections of a NASA Engineer (NASA SP-4109) | author= Iliff, Ken |date=January 1, 2004 |work=nasa.gov|accessdate=March 23, 2016 | page = 291 | quote = Not violating flight rules was something I had been taught on the X-15 program.

Ice had accumulated all over the launch pad, raising concerns that ice could damage the shuttle upon lift-off. The Kennedy Ice Team inadvertently pointed an infrared camera at the aft field joint of the right SRB and found the temperature to be only {{convert|−13|C|F}}. This was believed to be the result of supercooled air blowing on the joint from the [[Liquid_oxygen|liquid oxygen (LOX)]] tank vent. It was much lower than the air temperature and far below the design specifications for the O-rings. The low reading was later determined to be erroneous, the error caused by not following the temperature probe manufacturer's instructions. Tests and adjusted calculations later confirmed that the temperature of the joint was not substantially different from the ambient temperature.\n\nThe temperature on the day of the launch was far lower than had been the case with previous launches: below freezing at {{convert|−2.2|to|−1.7|C|F}}; previously, the coldest launch had been at {{convert|12|C|F}}. Although the Ice Team had worked through the night removing ice, engineers at Rockwell still expressed concern. Rockwell engineers watching the pad from their headquarters in [[Downey, California]], were horrified when they saw the amount of ice. They feared that during launch, ice might be shaken loose and strike the shuttle's thermal protection tiles, possibly due to the aspiration induced by the [[jet (fluid)|jet]] of [[exhaust gas]] from the SRBs. [[Rocco Petrone]], the head of Rockwell's space transportation division, and his colleagues viewed this situation as a launch constraint, and told Rockwell's managers at the Cape that Rockwell could not support a launch. Rockwell's managers at the Cape voiced their concerns in a manner that led Houston-based mission manager Arnold Aldrich to go ahead with the launch. Aldrich decided to postpone the shuttle launch by an hour to give the Ice Team time to perform another inspection. After that last inspection, during which the ice appeared to be melting, ''Challenger'' was cleared to launch at 11:38&nbsp;am EST.<ref name=\"rogers 5\" />\n{{clear right}}\n\n==January 28 launch and failure==\n{{further information|STS-51-L Mission timeline}}\n[[File:ChallengerSimple.png|thumb|Simplistic representation of the ''Space Shuttle Challenger'' disaster]]\n===Liftoff and initial ascent===\n{{refimprove section|date=January 2011}}\n[[File:STS-51-L grey smoke on SRB.jpg|thumb|left|Gray smoke escaping from the right side SRB]] <!-- This entire section reads like an official NASA report which I've read.

The SSMEs were liquid-fueled and could be safely shut down (and the launch aborted if necessary) until the Solid Rocket Boosters ignited at T=0 (which was at 11:38:00.010 EST) and the [[Space Shuttle Solid Rocket Booster#Hold-down posts|hold-down bolts]] were released with explosives, freeing the vehicle from the pad.  At lift off, the three SSMEs were at 100% of their original rated performance, and began throttling up to [[Space Shuttle Main Engine#Upgrades|104%]] under computer control. With the first vertical motion of the vehicle, the gaseous hydrogen vent arm retracted from the [[Space Shuttle external tank|External Tank (ET)]] but failed to latch back. Review of film shot by pad cameras showed that the arm did not re-contact the vehicle, and thus it was ruled out as a contributing factor in the accident.<ref name=\"rogers n\"/> The post-launch inspection of the pad also revealed that kick springs on four of the hold-down bolts were missing, but they were similarly ruled out as a possible cause.<ref name=\"tv team\">{{cite video | people= Photo and TV Analysis Team Report| title =Space Shuttle Challenger Accident Investigation| url =https://archive.org/details/ChallengerAccidentandInvestigation| publisher=STS-51L Data and Analysis Task Force |year = 1986 | accessdate=January 1, 2007}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Challenger Launch and Breakup.ogv|thumb|''Challenger'' launch and breakup]]\nLater review of launch film showed that at T+0.678, strong puffs of dark gray smoke were emitted from the right-hand SRB near the [[aft]] strut that attached the booster to the ET. The last smoke puff occurred at about T+2.733. The last view of smoke around the strut was at T+3.375. It was later determined that these smoke puffs were caused by the opening and closing of the aft field joint of the right-hand SRB. The booster's casing had ballooned under the stress of ignition. As a result of this ballooning, the metal parts of the casing bent away from each other, opening a gap through which hot gases—above {{convert|2,760|C|F}}—leaked. This had occurred in previous launches, but each time the primary O-ring had shifted out of its groove and formed a seal. Although the SRB was not designed to function this way, it appeared to work well enough, and Morton-Thiokol changed the design specs to accommodate this process, known as [[extrusion]].\n\nWhile extrusion was taking place, hot gases leaked past (a process called \"blow-by\"), damaging the O-rings until a seal was made. Investigations by Morton-Thiokol engineers determined that the amount of damage to the O-rings was directly related to the time it took for extrusion to occur, and that cold weather, by causing the O-rings to harden, lengthened the time of extrusion. (The redesigned SRB field joint used subsequent to the ''Challenger'' accident used an additional interlocking mortise and tang with a third O-ring, mitigating blow-by.)\n\nOn the morning of the disaster, the primary O-ring had become so hard due to the cold that it could not seal in time. The temperature had dropped below the [[glass transition]] temperature of the O-rings. Above the glass transition temperature, the O-rings display properties of elasticity and flexibility, while below the glass transition temperature, they become rigid and brittle. The secondary O-ring was not in its seated position due to the metal bending. There was now no barrier to the gases, and both O-rings were vaporized across 70 degrees of arc. [[Aluminum oxide]]s from the burned solid propellant sealed the damaged joint, temporarily replacing the O-ring seal before flame passed through the joint.\n\nAs the vehicle cleared the tower, the SSMEs were operating at [[Space Shuttle Main Engine#Thrust specifications|104% of their rated maximum thrust]], and control switched from the [[Launch Control Center]] (LCC) at Kennedy to the Mission Control Center (MCC) at [[Johnson Space Center]] in [[Houston, Texas]]. To prevent [[aerodynamics|aerodynamic]] forces from structurally overloading the orbiter, at T+28 the SSMEs began throttling down to limit the velocity of the shuttle in the dense [[troposphere|lower atmosphere]], per normal operating procedure. At T+35.379, the SSMEs throttled back further to the planned 65%. Five seconds later, at about {{convert|19000|ft|m}}, ''Challenger'' passed through [[Mach number|Mach 1]]. At T+51.860, the SSMEs began throttling back up to 104% as the vehicle passed beyond [[Max Q]], the period of maximum aerodynamic pressure on the vehicle.\n\n===Plume===\n[[File:Booster Rocket Breach - GPN-2000-001425.jpg|thumb|upright|Plume on right SRB at T+ 58.788 seconds]]\nBeginning at about T+37 and for 27 seconds, the shuttle experienced a series of [[Wind shear#Impact on passenger aircraft|wind shear]] events that were stronger than on any previous flight.<ref>{{cite web| author=NASA Mission Archives| title=STS-51L | url=http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/shuttle/shuttlemissions/archives/sts-51L.html | accessdate=January 31, 2010}}</ref>\n\nAt T+58.788, a tracking film camera captured the beginnings of a [[plume (hydrodynamics)|plume]] near the aft attach strut on the right SRB. Unknown to those on ''Challenger'' or in Houston, hot gas had begun to leak through a growing hole in one of the right-hand SRB joints. The force of the wind shear shattered the temporary oxide seal that had taken the place of the damaged O-rings, removing the last barrier to flame passing through the joint. Had it not been for the wind shear, the fortuitous oxide seal might have held through booster burnout.\n\nWithin a second, the plume became well defined and intense. Internal pressure in the right SRB began to drop because of the rapidly enlarging hole in the failed joint, and at T+60.238 there was visual evidence of flame burning through the joint and impinging on the external tank.<ref name=\"timeline\"/>\n\nAt T+64.660, the plume suddenly changed shape, indicating that a leak had begun in the [[liquid hydrogen]] (LH2) tank, located in the aft portion of the external tank. The nozzles of the main engines pivoted under computer control to compensate for the unbalanced thrust produced by the booster burn-through.

The two SRBs, which could withstand greater aerodynamic loads, separated from the ET and continued in uncontrolled powered flight. The SRB casings were made of half-inch (12.7&nbsp;mm) thick steel and were much stronger than the orbiter and ET; thus, both SRBs survived the breakup of the space shuttle stack, even though the right SRB was still suffering the effects of the joint burn-through that had set the destruction of ''Challenger'' in motion.<ref name=\"tv team\" />\n\nThe more robustly constructed crew cabin also survived the breakup of the launch vehicle, as it was designed to survive 20 psi while the estimated pressure it had been subjected to during orbiter breakup was only about 4–5 psi.; while the SRBs were subsequently destroyed remotely by the [[Range Safety Officer]], the detached cabin continued along a [[ballistics|ballistic]] trajectory and was observed exiting the cloud of gases at T+75.237.<ref name=\"tv team\"/> Twenty-five seconds after the breakup of the vehicle, the altitude of the crew compartment peaked at a height of {{convert|65000|ft|km}}.<ref name=\"kerwin\"/> The cabin was stabilized during descent by the large mass of electrical wires trailing behind it.\n\nThe Thiokol engineers who had opposed the decision to launch were watching the events on television.

Television screens showed a cloud of smoke and water vapor (the product of hydrogen+oxygen combustion) where ''Challenger'' had been, with pieces of debris falling toward the ocean. At about T+89, flight director [[Jay Greene]] prompted his [[Flight controller#Flight Dynamics Officer .28FDO or FIDO.29 2|Flight Dynamics Officer]] (FIDO) for information. FIDO responded that \"the {{bracket|[[radar]]}} filter has discreting sources\", a further indication that ''Challenger'' had broken into multiple pieces. Moments later, the [[Ground Controller|ground controller]] reported \"negative contact (and) loss of downlink\" of radio and telemetry data from ''Challenger''. Greene ordered his team to \"watch your data carefully\" and look for any sign that the Orbiter had escaped.\n\nAt T+110.250, the range safety officer (RSO) at the [[Cape Canaveral Air Force Station]] sent radio signals that activated the [[Space Shuttle Solid Rocket Booster#Range safety system|range safety system's]] \"destruct\" packages on board both solid rocket boosters.

NASA estimated the load factor at separation to be between 12 and 20 g; within two seconds it had already dropped to below 4 g and within 10 seconds the cabin was in [[free fall]]. The forces involved at this stage were probably insufficient to cause major injury.\n\nAt least some of the crew were probably alive and at least briefly conscious after the breakup, as three of the four recovered [[Personal Egress Air Packs]] (PEAPs) on the flight deck were found to have been activated.<ref>[http://science.ksc.nasa.gov/shuttle/missions/51-l/docs/kerwin.txt Joseph P.

Fellow astronaut [[Richard Mullane]] wrote, \"These switches were protected with lever locks that required them to be pulled outward against a spring force before they could be moved to a new position.\" Later tests established that neither force of the explosion nor the impact with the ocean could have moved them, indicating that Smith made the switch changes, presumably in a futile attempt to restore electrical power to the cockpit after the crew cabin detached from the rest of the orbiter.<ref name=Mullane>{{Cite book | last = Mullane | first = Mike | authorlink = Mike Mullane | title = Riding Rockets: The Outrageous Tales of a Space Shuttle Astronaut | publisher=Simon and Schuster | year = 2006 | page = 245 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=8X7ceB3QEWkC&lpg=PP1&pg=PA245#v=onepage&q= | isbn = 978-0-7432-7682-5 |accessdate=July 12, 2011}}</ref>\n\nWhether the crew members remained conscious long after the breakup is unknown, and largely depends on whether the detached crew cabin maintained pressure integrity. If it did not, the time of useful consciousness at that altitude is just a few seconds; the PEAPs supplied only unpressurized air, and hence would not have helped the crew to retain consciousness. If, on the other hand, the cabin was not depressurized or only slowly depressurizing, they may have been conscious for the entire fall until impact. Recovery of the cabin found that the middeck floor had not suffered buckling or tearing, as would result from a rapid decompression, thus providing some evidence that the depressurization may have not happened all at once.\n\nNASA routinely trained shuttle crews for splashdown events, but the cabin hit the ocean surface at roughly {{convert|207|mph|km/h|abbr=on}}, with an estimated deceleration at impact of well over 200 [[Gravity of Earth|g]], far beyond the structural limits of the crew compartment or crew survivability levels, and far greater than almost any automobile, aircraft, or train accident. The crew would have been torn from their seats and killed instantly by the extreme impact force.<ref name=\"kerwin\"/>\n\nOn July 28, 1986, NASA's Associate Administrator for Space Flight, former astronaut [[Richard H. Truly]], released a report on the deaths of the crew from the director of Space and Life Sciences at the [[Lyndon B. Johnson Space Center|Johnson Space Center]], [[Joseph P. Kerwin]]. A medical doctor and former astronaut, Kerwin was a veteran of the 1973 [[Skylab 2]] mission. According to the Kerwin Report:\n\n{{quote|The findings are inconclusive. The impact of the crew compartment with the ocean surface was so violent that evidence of damage occurring in the seconds which followed the disintegration was masked. Our final conclusions are:\n* the cause of death of the ''Challenger'' astronauts cannot be positively determined;\n* the forces to which the crew were exposed during Orbiter breakup were probably not sufficient to cause death or serious injury; and\n* the crew possibly, but not certainly, lost consciousness in the seconds following Orbiter breakup due to in-flight loss of crew module pressure.<ref name=\"kerwin\"/>}}\n\nSome experts believe most if not all of the crew were alive and possibly conscious during the entire descent until impact with the ocean. Astronaut and NASA lead accident investigator [[Robert Overmyer]] said, \"I not only flew with Dick Scobee, we owned a plane together, and I know Scob did everything he could to save his crew. Scob fought for any and every edge to survive. He flew that ship without wings all the way down... they were alive.\"<ref name=\"Breakup\" />\n\n===Prospect of crew escape===\n{{Further2|[[Space Shuttle abort modes#Ejection escape systems|Shuttle ejection escape systems]], [[Space Shuttle abort modes#Post-Challenger abort enhancements|Post-''Challenger'' abort enhancements]]}}\n\nDuring powered flight of the space shuttle, crew escape was not possible. Launch escape systems were considered several times during shuttle development, but NASA's conclusion was that the shuttle's expected high reliability would preclude the need for one. Modified [[SR-71 Blackbird]] [[ejection seat]]s and full [[pressure suit]]s were used for the two-man crews on the first four shuttle orbital missions, which were considered test flights, but they were removed for the \"operational\" missions that followed. (The [[Columbia Accident Investigation Board]] later declared, after the 2003 [[Space Shuttle Columbia disaster|''Columbia'' re-entry disaster]], that the space shuttle system should never have been declared operational because it is experimental by nature due to the limited number of flights as compared to certified commercial aircraft.) The multi-deck design of the crew cabin precluded use of such ejection seats for larger crews. Providing some sort of launch escape system had been considered, but deemed impractical due to \"limited utility, technical complexity and excessive cost in dollars, weight or schedule delays.\"<ref name=\"rogers 9\" />\n\nAfter the loss of ''Challenger'', the question was re-opened, and NASA considered several different options, including ejector seats, tractor rockets and emergency egress through the bottom of the orbiter. NASA once again concluded that all of the launch escape systems considered would be impractical due to the sweeping vehicle modifications that would have been necessary and the resultant limitations on crew size. A system was designed to give the crew the option to leave the shuttle during [[gliding (flight)|gliding flight]], but this system would not have been usable in the ''Challenger'' situation.<ref>{{cite web| author=Rogers Commission | title=Implementation of the Recommendations of the Presidential Commission on the Space Shuttle Challenger Accident, Recommendation VII |date=June 1987 | url=https://history.nasa.gov/rogersrep/v6ch6.htm | accessdate=July 12, 2011}}</ref>\n\n==Aftermath==\n{{wikisource|Ronald Reagan Announces the Challenger Disaster}}\n[[File:Reagan Space Shuttle Challenger Speech.ogv|thumb|thumbtime=15|left|[[President of the United States|U.S. President]] [[Ronald Reagan]] addresses the nation after the shuttle disaster.]]\n\n===Tributes===\nOn the night of the disaster, [[President of the United States|President]] [[Ronald Reagan]] had been scheduled to give his annual [[State of the Union address]].

The largest intact section was the rear wall containing the two payload bay windows and the airlock. All windows in the cabin had been destroyed, with only small bits of glass still attached to the frames. Impact forces appeared to be greatest on the left side, indicating that it had struck the water in a nose-down, left-end first position.\n\nInside the twisted debris of the crew cabin were the bodies of the astronauts, which after weeks of immersion in salt water and exposure to scavenging marine life were in a semi-liquefied state that bore little resemblance to anything living, although according to John Devlin, the skipper of the USS ''Preserver'', they \"were not as badly mangled as you'd see in some aircraft accidents\". Lt. Cmdr James Simpson of the Coast Guard reported finding a helmet with ears and a scalp in it.<ref>http://www.lutins.org/nasa.html</ref> Judy Resnik was the first to be removed followed by Christa McAuliffe with more human remains retrieved over several hours. Due to the hazardous nature of the recovery operation (the cabin was filled with large pieces of protruding jagged metal), the Navy divers protested that they would not go on with the work unless the cabin was hauled onto the ship's deck. Despite the desire to be respectful to the dead, the bodies were said to have been handled less gingerly than the recovered memory core units and tape recorders, whose contents were vital in the accident investigation.{{Citation needed|date=February 2018}}\n\nDuring the recovery of the remains of the crew, Gregory Jarvis's body floated out of the shattered crew compartment and was lost to the diving team. A day later, it was seen floating on the ocean's surface. It sank as a team prepared to pull it from the water. Determined to not end the recovery operations without retrieving Jarvis, astronaut [[Robert Crippen]] rented a fishing boat at his own expense and went searching for the body. On April 15, near the end of the salvage operations, the Navy divers found Jarvis. His body had settled to the sea floor, {{convert|101.2|ft|m}} below the surface, some {{convert|0.7|nmi|km|adj=on}} from the final resting place of the crew compartment. The body was recovered and brought to the surface before being processed with the other crew members and then prepared for release to Jarvis's family.{{Citation needed|date=January 2018}}\n\nNavy pathologists performed autopsies on the crew members, but due to the poor condition of the bodies, no exact cause of death could be determined for any of them.\n\nThe crew transfer took place on April 29, 1986, three months and one day after the accident. Seven hearses carried the crew's remains from the Life Sciences Facility on Cape Canaveral, to a waiting [[Military Airlift Command|MAC]] [[C-141]] aircraft. Their caskets were each draped with an American flag and carried past an honor guard and followed by an astronaut escort. The astronaut escorts for the ''Challenger'' crew were: Dan Brandenstein, Jim Buckley, Norm Thagard, Charles Bolden, Tammy Jernigan, Dick Richards, and Loren Shriver. Once the crew's remains were aboard the jet, they were flown to Dover Air Force Base in Delaware to be processed and then released to their relatives.\n\nIt had been suggested early in the investigation that the accident was caused by inadvertent detonation of the Range Safety destruct charges on the external tank, but the charges were recovered mostly intact and a quick overview of telemetry data immediately ruled out that theory.\n\nThe three shuttle main engines were found largely intact and still attached to the thrust assembly despite extensive damage from impact with the ocean, marine life, and immersion in salt water. They had considerable heat damage due to a LOX-rich shutdown caused by the drop in hydrogen fuel pressure as the external tank began to fail. The memory units from Engines 1 and 2 were recovered, cleaned, and their contents analyzed, which confirmed normal engine operation until LH2 starvation began starting at T+72 seconds. Loss of fuel pressure and rising combustion chamber temperatures caused the computers to shut off the engines. Since there was no evidence of abnormal SSME behavior until 72 seconds, the engines were ruled out as a contributing factor in the accident.\n\nOther recovered orbiter components showed no indication of pre-breakup malfunction. Recovered parts of the TDRSS satellite also did not disclose any abnormalities other than damage caused by vehicle breakup, impact, and immersion in salt water. The solid rocket motor boost stage for the payload had not ignited either and was quickly ruled out as a cause of the accident.\n\nThe solid rocket booster debris had no signs of explosion (other than the Range Safety charges splitting the casings open), or propellant debonding/cracking. There was no question about the RSO manually destroying the SRBs following vehicle breakup, so the idea of the destruct charges accidentally detonating was ruled out. Premature separation of the SRBs from the stack or inadvertent activation of the recovery system was also considered, but telemetry data quickly disproved that idea. Nor was there any evidence of in-flight structural failure since visual and telemetry evidence showed that the SRBs remained structurally intact up to and beyond vehicle breakup. The aft field joint on the right SRB did show extensive burn damage.\n\nTelemetry proved that the right SRB, after the failure of the lower struts, had come loose and struck the external tank. The exact point where the struts broke could not be determined from film of the launch, nor were the struts or the adjacent section of the external tank recovered during salvage operations. Based on the location of the rupture in the right SRB, the P12 strut most likely failed first. The SRB's nose cone also exhibited some impact damage from this behavior (for comparison, the left SRB nose cone had no damage at all) and the intertank region had signs of impact damage as well.

The commission members were Chairman [[William P. Rogers]], Vice Chairman [[Neil Armstrong]], [[David Campion Acheson|David Acheson]], [[Eugene E. Covert|Eugene Covert]], [[Richard Feynman]], Robert Hotz, [[Donald J. Kutyna|Donald Kutyna]], [[Sally Ride]], Robert Rummel, [[Joe Sutter|Joseph Sutter]], [[Arthur B. C. Walker, Jr.|Arthur Walker]], Albert Wheelon, and [[Chuck Yeager]]. The commission worked for several months and published a report of its findings. It found that the ''Challenger'' accident was caused by a failure in the O-rings sealing a joint on the right solid rocket booster, which allowed pressurized hot gases and eventually flame to \"blow by\" the O-ring and make contact with the adjacent external tank, causing structural failure. The failure of the O-rings was attributed to a faulty design, whose performance could be too easily compromised by factors including the low temperature on the day of launch.<ref>{{cite book| author=Rogers Commission | title=Report of the Presidential Commission on the Space Shuttle Challenger Accident|chapter= Chapter IV: The Cause of the Accident | date=June 6, 1986| url=https://history.nasa.gov/rogersrep/v1ch4.htm| accessdate=July 12, 2011}}</ref>\n[[File:Rogers Commission members arrive at Kennedy Space Center.jpg|thumb|left|Members of the [[Rogers Commission]] arrive at [[Kennedy Space Center]].]]\n\nMore broadly, the report also considered the contributing causes of the accident. Most salient was the failure of both NASA and Morton Thiokol to respond adequately to the danger posed by the deficient joint design. Rather than redesigning the joint, they came to define the problem as an acceptable flight risk. The report found that managers at Marshall had known about the flawed design since 1977, but never discussed the problem outside their reporting channels with Thiokol—a flagrant violation of NASA regulations. Even when it became more apparent how serious the flaw was, no one at Marshall considered grounding the shuttles until a fix could be implemented. On the contrary, Marshall managers went as far as to issue and waive six launch constraints related to the O-rings.<ref name=\"Rogers_vol6\" /> The report also strongly criticized the decision-making process that led to the launch of ''Challenger'', saying that it was seriously flawed:<ref name=\"rogers 5\" />\n\n{{quote|failures in communication ... resulted in a decision to launch 51-L based on incomplete and sometimes misleading information, a conflict between engineering data and management judgments, and a NASA management structure that permitted internal flight safety problems to bypass key Shuttle managers.|Rogers Commission Report Chapter V<ref name=\"rogers 5\" />}}\n\n====Richard Feynman====\nOne of the commission's members was theoretical physicist [[Richard Feynman]]. Feynman, who was then seriously ill with cancer, was reluctant to undertake the job. He did so to find the root cause of the disaster, and to speak plainly to the public about his findings.<ref>Freeman Dyson, 2011, \"The Dramatic Picture of Richard Feynman, \" New York Review of Books, July 14, 2011. Reprinted in {{ISBN|9781590178546}}</ref> At the start of investigation, fellow members Dr. [[Sally Ride]] and [[Donald J.

While other members of the Commission met with NASA and supplier top management, Feynman sought out the engineers and technicians for the answers.<ref name=\"WDYC\"/> He was critical of flaws in NASA's \"safety culture\", so much so that he threatened to remove his name from the report unless it included his personal observations on the reliability of the shuttle, which appeared as Appendix F.<ref name=\"WDYC\">{{cite book | last = Feynman| first = Richard P. | authorlink = Richard Feynman | title = What Do You Care What Other People Think?

Bolden]] reads a passage from the Bible during memorial services for the seven ''Challenger'' crew members]]\nAfter the ''Challenger'' accident, further shuttle flights were suspended, pending the results of the Rogers Commission investigation. Whereas NASA had held an internal inquiry into the [[Apollo 1]] fire in 1967, its actions after ''Challenger'' were more constrained by the judgment of outside bodies. The Rogers Commission offered nine recommendations on improving safety in the space shuttle program, and NASA was directed by President Reagan to report back within thirty days as to how it planned to implement those recommendations.<ref name=\"implementation report\">{{cite web| title = Report to the President: Actions to Implement the Recommendations of the Presidential Commission on the Space Shuttle Challenger Accident|publisher=NASA| date=July 14, 1986| url = https://history.nasa.gov/rogersrep/actions.pdf | format = PDF}}</ref>\n\nWhen the disaster happened, the Air Force had performed extensive modifications of its [[Vandenberg AFB Space Launch Complex 6|Space Launch Complex 6]] (SLC-6, pronounced as \"Slick Six\") at [[Vandenberg Air Force Base]] in California, for launch and landing operations of classified Shuttle launches of satellites in polar orbit, and was planning its first polar flight for October 15, 1986.

The ''Challenger'' loss motivated the Air Force to set in motion a chain of events that finally led to the May 13, 1988 decision to cancel its Vandenberg Shuttle launch plans, in favor of the [[Titan IV]] unmanned launch vehicle.\n\nIn response to the commission's recommendation, NASA initiated a total redesign of the space shuttle's solid rocket boosters, which was watched over by an independent oversight group as stipulated by the commission.<ref name=\"implementation report\"/> NASA's contract with [[Morton Thiokol]], the contractor responsible for the solid rocket boosters, included a clause stating that in the event of a failure leading to \"loss of life or mission,\" Thiokol would forfeit $10&nbsp;million of its incentive fee and formally accept legal liability for the failure. After the ''Challenger'' accident, Thiokol agreed to \"voluntarily accept\" the monetary penalty in exchange for not being forced to accept liability.<ref name=\"Downlink\">Jensen, Claus.

After the accident, NASA attempted to aim at a more realistic shuttle flight rate: it added another orbiter, ''[[Space Shuttle Endeavour|Endeavour]]'', to the space shuttle fleet to replace ''Challenger'', and it worked with the Department of Defense to put more satellites in orbit using [[expendable launch vehicle]]s rather than the shuttle.<ref name=\"rogerscommission\">{{cite web| author=Rogers Commission | title=Implementation of the Recommendations of the Presidential Commission on the Space Shuttle Challenger Accident, Recommendation VII|date=June 1987 | url=https://history.nasa.gov/rogersrep/v6ch7.htm | accessdate=July 12, 2011}}</ref>  In August 1986, President Reagan also announced that the shuttle would no longer carry commercial [[satellite]] payloads.<ref name=\"rogerscommission\" />  After a 32-month hiatus, the next shuttle mission, [[STS-26]], was launched on September 29, 1988.\n\nAlthough changes were made by NASA after the ''Challenger'' accident, many commentators have argued that the changes in its management structure and organizational culture were neither deep nor long-lasting.\n\nAfter the [[Space Shuttle Columbia disaster|Space Shuttle ''Columbia'' disaster]] in 2003, attention once again focused on the attitude of NASA management towards safety issues. The [[Columbia Accident Investigation Board]] (CAIB) concluded that NASA had failed to learn many of the lessons of ''Challenger''. In particular, the agency had not set up a truly independent office for safety oversight; the CAIB felt that in this area, \"NASA's response to the Rogers Commission did not meet the Commission's intent\".<ref>{{cite book| author=Columbia Accident Investigation Board| title=Report of Columbia Accident Investigation Board|chapter= Volume I, Chapter 7|page= 178 |year=2003| url=http://anon.nasa-global.speedera.net/anon.nasa-global/CAIB/CAIB_lowres_chapter7.pdf|format=PDF|accessdate=July 12, 2011}}</ref> The CAIB believed that \"the causes of the institutional failure responsible for ''Challenger'' have not been fixed,\" saying that the same \"flawed decision making process\" that had resulted in the ''Challenger'' accident was responsible for [[Space Shuttle Columbia|''Columbia'''s]] destruction seventeen years later.<ref>{{cite book| author=Columbia Accident Investigation Board| title=Report of Columbia Accident Investigation Board|chapter= Volume I, Chapter 8| page= 195 |year=2003| url=http://anon.nasa-global.speedera.net/anon.nasa-global/CAIB/CAIB_lowres_chapter8.pdf|format=PDF|accessdate=July 12, 2011}}</ref>\n\n===Media coverage===\nWhile the presence of [[New Hampshire]]'s [[Christa McAuliffe]], a member of the [[Teacher in Space]] program, on the ''Challenger'' crew had provoked some media interest, there was little live broadcast coverage of the launch.

Both Palmer and CBS anchor [[Dan Rather]] reacted to cameras catching live video of something descending by parachute into the area where ''Challenger'' debris was falling with confusion and speculation that a crew member may have ejected from the shuttle and survived.  The shuttle had no individual ejection seats or a crew escape capsule.  Mission control identified the parachute as a paramedic parachuting into the area but this was also incorrect based on internal speculation at mission control.  The chute was the parachute and nose cone from one of the solid rocket boosters which had been destroyed by the [[range safety officer]] after the explosion.<ref>http://spaceflightnow.com/challenger/timeline/#</ref>  Due to McAuliffe's presence on the mission, NASA arranged for many US public schools to view the launch live on [[NASA TV]].<ref name=myths>{{cite web\n | url = http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/11031097/\n | title = 7 myths about the Challenger shuttle disaster\n | author=James Oberg\n |publisher=msnbc.com | date=January 25, 2011}}</ref> As a result, many who were schoolchildren in the US in 1986 had the opportunity to view the launch live.

He argues that if Morton Thiokol engineers had more clearly presented the data that they had on the relationship between low temperatures and burn-through in the solid rocket booster joints, they might have succeeded in persuading NASA managers to cancel the launch. To demonstrate this, he took all of the data he claimed the engineers had presented during the briefing, and reformatted it onto a single graph of O-ring damage versus external launch temperature, showing the effects of cold on the degree of O-ring damage. Tufte then placed the proposed launch of ''Challenger'' on the graph according to its predicted temperature at launch. According to Tufte, the launch temperature of ''Challenger'' was so far below the coldest launch, with the worst damage seen to date, that even a casual observer could have determined that the risk of disaster was severe.<ref>[[Edward Tufte]]. (1997) ''Visual Explanations'', {{ISBN|0-9613921-2-6}}, Chapter 2.</ref>\n\nTufte has also argued that poor presentation of information may have also affected NASA decisions during the last flight of the space shuttle ''[[Columbia disaster|Columbia]]''.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.edwardtufte.com/bboard/q-and-a-fetch-msg?msg_id=0001yB&topic_id=1|title= PowerPoint Does Rocket Science—and Better Techniques for Technical Reports |accessdate=January 28, 2007 |author=Tufte, Edward}}</ref>\n\nBoisjoly, Wade Robison, a [[Rochester Institute of Technology]] professor, and their colleagues have vigorously repudiated Tufte's conclusions about the Morton Thiokol engineers' role in the loss of ''Challenger''. First, they argue that the engineers didn't have the information available as Tufte claimed: \"But they did not know the temperatures even though they did try to obtain that information. Tufte has not gotten the facts right even though the information was available to him had he looked for it.\"<ref name=WadeNAE96>{{cite journal |author1=Robison, W. |author2=Boisjoly, R. |author3=Hoeker, D. |author4=Young, S. |last-author-amp=yes | year = 2002 | title = Representation and Misrepresentation: Tufte and the Morton Thiokol Engineers on the Challenger | journal = Science and Engineering Ethics | volume = 8 | issue =  | pages = 59–81 | url=https://people.rit.edu/wlrgsh/FINRobison.pdf |accessdate=November 9, 2016}}</ref><ref>The preceding reference is used by the Online Ethics Center for Engineering and Research of the National Academy of Engineering of the National Academies.</ref> They further argue that Tufte \"misunderstands thoroughly the argument and evidence the engineers gave.\"<ref name=WadeNAE96/> They also criticized Tufte's diagram as \"fatally flawed by Tufte's own criteria. The vertical axis tracks the wrong effect, and the horizontal axis cites temperatures not available to the engineers and, in addition, mixes O-ring temperatures and ambient air temperature as though the two were the same.\"<ref name=WadeNAE96/>\n\nThe ''Challenger'' disaster also provided a chance to see how traumatic events affected children's psyches. At least one psychological study has found that memories of the ''Challenger'' explosion were similar to memories of experiencing single, unrepeated traumas. The majority of children's memories of ''Challenger'' were often clear and consistent, and even things like personal placement such as who they were with or what they were doing when they heard the news were remembered well. In one U.S. study, children's memories were recorded and tested again. Children on the East Coast recalled the event more easily than children on the West Coast, due to the time difference. Children on the East Coast either saw the explosion on TV while in school, or heard people talking about it. On the other side of the country, most children were either on their way to school, or just beginning their morning classes. Researchers found that those children who saw the explosion on TV had a more emotional connection to the event, and thus had an easier time remembering it. After one year the children's memories were tested, and those on the East Coast recalled the event better than their West Coast counterparts. Regardless of where they were when it happened, the ''Challenger'' explosion was still an important event that many children easily remembered.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://ajp.psychiatryonline.org/doi/abs/10.1176/ajp.153.5.618|title=Connect with us!|date=|work=psychiatryonline.org|accessdate=March 23, 2016}}</ref>\n\n===Continuation of the Shuttle Program===\nAfter the accident, NASA's Space Shuttle fleet was grounded for almost three years while the investigation, hearings, engineering redesign of the SRBs, and other behind-the-scenes technical and management reviews, changes, and preparations were taking place.

It carried a Tracking and Data Relay Satellite, TDRS-C (named TDRS-3 after deployment), which replaced TDRS-B, the satellite that was launched and lost on ''Challenger''. The \"Return to Flight\" launch of ''Discovery'' also represented a test of the redesigned boosters, a shift to a more conservative stance on safety (e.g., it was the first time the crew had launched in pressure suits since STS-4, the last of the four initial Shuttle test flights), and a chance to restore national pride in the American space program, especially manned space flight. The mission, [[STS-26]], was a success (with only two minor system failures, one of a cabin cooling system and one of a Ku-band antenna), and a regular schedule of STS flights followed, continuing without extended interruption until the 2003 ''Columbia'' disaster.\n\n[[Barbara Morgan]], the backup for McAuliffe who trained with her in the Teacher in Space program and was at KSC watching her launch on January 28, 1986, flew on [[STS-118]] as a Mission Specialist in August 2007.\n\n==Legacy==\n[[File:Challenger Memorial1.JPG|thumb|upright|The Space Shuttle ''Challenger'' Memorial in Arlington National Cemetery, where some remains were buried]]\nThe families of the ''Challenger'' crew organized the [[Challenger Center for Space Science Education]] as a permanent memorial to the crew.

It occurred on 25–26 April 1986 in the No.4 [[RBMK|light water graphite moderated reactor]] at the [[Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant]] near [[Pripyat]], a town in northern [[Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic]] which was part of the [[Soviet Union]] (USSR), approximately 104&nbsp;km north of [[Kiev]].<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.britannica.com/story/nuclear-exclusion-zones|title=Nuclear Exclusion Zones|work=Encyclopedia Britannica|access-date=15 January 2018|language=en}}</ref>\n\nThe event occurred during a late-night safety test which simulated a [[power blackout|station blackout]] power-failure, in the course of which [[control rod|safety systems]] were intentionally turned off. A combination of inherent [[RBMK|reactor design flaws]] and the reactor operators [[Iodine pit|arranging the core]] in a manner contrary to the [[checklist]] for the test, eventually resulted in [[Criticality accident|uncontrolled reaction conditions]]. Water flashed into steam generating a destructive [[steam explosion]] and a subsequent open-air [[nuclear graphite|graphite]] fire.<ref group=\"note\" name=\"external\">Although most reports on the Chernobyl accident refer to a number of graphite fires, it is highly unlikely that the graphite itself burned. According to the [[General Atomics]] website <{{cite web |url=http://gt-mhr.ga.com/safety.php |title=Archived copy |accessdate=13 October 2016 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120717102758/http://gt-mhr.ga.com/safety.php |archivedate=17 July 2012 |df=dmy-all }}>: \"It is often incorrectly assumed that the combustion behavior of graphite is similar to that of [[charcoal]] and coal. Numerous tests and calculations have shown that it is virtually impossible to burn high-purity, nuclear-grade graphites.\" On Chernobyl, the same source states: \"Graphite played little or no role in the progression or consequences of the accident. The red glow observed during the Chernobyl accident was the expected color of [[black-body radiation|luminescence]] for graphite at 700°C and not a large-scale graphite fire, as some have incorrectly assumed.\" Similarly, nuclear physicist Yevgeny Velikhov,<http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/4918742.stm> noted some 2 weeks after the accident, \"Until now the possibility of a catastrophe really did exist: A great quantity of fuel and graphite of the reactor was in an [[incandescent]] state\" That is, all the nuclear-[[decay heat]] that was generated inside the uranium fuel([[Loss-of-coolant accident|heat which would normally be extracted by back-up coolant pumps, in an undamaged reactor]]) was instead responsible for making the fuel itself and any graphite in contact with it, to glow [[incandescent|red-hot]]. This is contrary to the oft cited interpretation, which is that the graphite was red-hot chiefly because it was chemically [[oxidizing]] with the air.</ref> This fire produced considerable [[updraft]]s for about nine days. These lofted [[plume (fluid dynamics)|plume]]s of [[Nuclear fission product|fission products]] into the atmosphere. The estimated radioactive inventory that was released during this very hot fire phase approximately equaled in magnitude the airborne fission products released in the initial destructive explosion.<ref name=\"OECD02-Ch2\">{{cite web | url=https://www.oecd-nea.org/rp/reports/2003/nea3508-chernobyl.pdf | title = Chernobyl: Assessment of Radiological and Health Impact, 2002 update; Chapter II – The release, dispersion and deposition of radionuclides | year=2002 | publisher = OECD-NEA | accessdate= 3 June 2015}}</ref> Practically all of this radioactive material would then go on to [[nuclear fallout|fall-out]]/precipitate onto much of the surface of the western USSR and Europe.\n\nThe Chernobyl accident dominates the [[energy accidents]] sub-category of most disastrous nuclear power plant accident in history, both in terms of cost and casualties.

An initial test carried out in 1982 indicated that the [[excitation (magnetic)|excitation]] voltage of the turbine-generator was insufficient; it did not maintain the desired [[magnetic field]] after the turbine trip. The system was modified, and the test was repeated in 1984 but again proved unsuccessful. In 1985, the tests were attempted a third time but also yielded negative results. The test procedure would be repeated in 1986, and it was scheduled to take place during the maintenance shutdown of Reactor Four.<ref name=\"NV Karpan: 312–13\"/>\n\nThe test focused on the switching sequences of the electrical supplies for the reactor. The test procedure was expected to begin with an automatic emergency shutdown. No detrimental effect on the safety of the reactor was anticipated, so the test programme was not formally coordinated with either the chief designer of the reactor (NIKIET) or the scientific manager. Instead, it was approved only by the director of the plant (and even this approval was not consistent with established procedures).<ref name=insag7/>\n\nAccording to the test parameters, the thermal output of the reactor should have been ''no lower'' than 700&nbsp;MW at the start of the experiment. If test conditions had been as planned, the procedure would almost certainly have been carried out safely; the eventual disaster resulted from attempts to boost the reactor output once the experiment had been started, which was inconsistent with approved procedure.<ref name=insag7/>\n\nThe Chernobyl power plant had been in operation for two years without the capability to ride through the first 60–75 seconds of a total loss of electric power, and thus lacked an important safety feature. The station managers presumably wished to correct this at the first opportunity, which may explain why they continued the test even when serious problems arose, and why the requisite approval for the test had not been sought from the Soviet nuclear oversight regulator (even though there was a representative at the complex of 4 reactors).<ref name=\"Medvedev Z\" group= notes>\"The mere fact that the operators were carrying out an experiment that had not been approved by higher officials indicates that something was wrong with the chain of command.

A special team of [[electrical engineer]]s was present to test the new voltage regulating system.<ref>{{Harvard citation no brackets|Dyatlov|2003|p=30}}</ref> As planned, a gradual reduction in the output of the power unit was begun at 01:06 on 25 April, and the power level had reached 50% of its nominal 3200&nbsp;MW thermal level by the beginning of the day shift.\n\n[[File:RBMK en.svg|thumb|400px|right|A schematic diagram of the reactor]]\n\nAt this point, another regional power station unexpectedly went offline, and the [[Kiev]] [[electrical grid]] controller requested that the further reduction of Chernobyl's output be postponed, as power was needed to satisfy the peak evening demand. The Chernobyl plant director agreed, and postponed the test. Despite this delay, preparations for the test not affecting the reactor's power were carried out, including the disabling of the emergency core cooling system or ECCS, a passive/active system of core cooling intended to provide water to the core in a [[loss-of-coolant accident]]. Given the other events that unfolded, the system would have been of limited use, but its disabling as a \"routine\" step of the test is an illustration of the inherent lack of attention to safety for this test.<ref name=\"OECD02-Ch1\">{{cite web| url=https://www.oecd-nea.org/rp/reports/2003/nea3508-chernobyl.pdf |title=Chernobyl: Assessment of Radiological and Health Impact, 2002 update; Chapter I – The site and accident sequence |publisher=OECD-NEA | year=2002 |accessdate=3 June 2015}}</ref> In addition, had the reactor been shut down for the day as planned, it is possible that more preparation would have been taken in advance of the test.\n\nAt 23:04, the Kiev grid controller allowed the reactor shutdown to resume.

According to plan, the test should have been finished during the day shift, and the night shift would only have had to maintain decay heat cooling systems in an otherwise shut-down plant.<ref name=\"MedvedevZ\"/>{{rp|36–38}}\n\nThe night shift had very limited time to prepare for and carry out the experiment. A further rapid decrease in the power level from 50% was executed during the shift change-over. [[Alexander Akimov]] was chief of the night shift, and Leonid Toptunov was the operator responsible for the reactor's operational regimen, including the movement of the [[control rod]]s. Toptunov was a young engineer who had worked independently as a senior engineer for approximately three months.<ref name=\"MedvedevZ\"/>{{rp|36–38}}\n\nThe test plan called for a gradual decrease in power output from reactor 4 to a thermal level of 700–1000&nbsp;MW.<ref>{{cite web |language=Russian |url=http://rrc2.narod.ru/book/app7.html |title=The official program of the test}}</ref> An output of 700&nbsp;MW was reached at 00:05 on 26 April. Due to the reactor's production of  a fission byproduct, [[xenon-135]], which is a reaction-inhibiting [[neutron absorber]], core power continued to decrease without further operator action—a process known as [[Iodine pit|reactor poisoning]]. This continuing decrease in power occurred because in ''steady state operation'', xenon-135 is \"burned off\" as quickly as it is created from decaying [[Isotopes of iodine#Iodine-135 and nuclear reactor control|iodine-135]] by absorbing neutrons from the ongoing chain reaction to become highly stable [[xenon-136]]. When the reactor power was lowered, previously produced high quantities of iodine-135 decayed into the neutron-absorbing xenon-135 faster than the reduced [[neutron flux]] could burn it off. As the reactor power output dropped further, to approximately 500&nbsp;MW, Toptunov mistakenly inserted the control rods too far—the exact circumstances leading to this are unknown because Akimov and Toptunov both died in the hospital on 10 and 14 May respectively. This combination of factors put the reactor into an unintended near-[[shutdown (nuclear reactor)|shutdown]] state, with a power output of 30&nbsp;MW thermal or less.\n\nThe reactor was now producing 5&nbsp;percent of the minimum initial power level established as safe for the test.<ref name=insag7/>{{rp|73}} Control-room personnel decided to restore power by disabling the automatic system governing the control rods and manually extracting the majority of the reactor control rods to their upper limits.<ref>{{Harvard citation no brackets|Dyatlov|2003|p=31}}</ref> Several minutes elapsed between their extraction and the point that the power output began to increase and subsequently stabilize at 160–200&nbsp;MW (thermal), a much smaller value than the planned 700&nbsp;MW. The rapid reduction in the power during the initial shutdown, and the subsequent operation at a level of less than 200&nbsp;MW led to increased poisoning of the [[reactor core]] by the accumulation of xenon-135.<ref name=\"nf\">{{cite web | url=http://nuclearfissionary.com/2010/03/03/what-happened-at-chernobyl/ | title=What Happened at Chernobyl? | accessdate=12 January 2011 | publisher=Nuclear Fissionary | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110714210818/http://nuclearfissionary.com/2010/03/03/what-happened-at-chernobyl/ | archivedate=14 July 2011 | df=dmy-all }}</ref><ref>The accumulation of Xe-135 in the core is burned out by neutrons. Higher power settings bring higher neutron flux and burn the xenon out more quickly. Conversely, low power settings result in the accumulation of xenon.</ref> This restricted any further rise of reactor power, and made it necessary to extract additional control rods from the reactor core in order to counteract the poisoning.\n\nThe operation of the reactor at the low power level and high poisoning level was accompanied by unstable core temperature and coolant flow, and possibly by instability of neutron flux, which triggered alarms. The control room received repeated emergency signals regarding the levels in the steam/water separator drums, and large excursions or variations in the flow rate of feed water, as well as from [[relief valve]]s opened to relieve excess steam into a [[condenser (heat transfer)|turbine condenser]], and from the neutron power controller. Between 00:35 and 00:45, emergency alarm signals concerning [[thermal-hydraulic]] parameters were ignored, apparently to preserve the reactor power level.<ref>[http://accidont.ru/expert.html The information on accident at the Chernobyl NPP and its consequences, prepared for IAEA], Atomic Energy, v. 61, 1986, pp. 308–320.</ref>\n\nWhen the power level of 200&nbsp;MW was achieved, preparation for the experiment continued. As part of the test plan, extra water pumps were activated at 01:05 on 26 April, increasing the water flow. The increased coolant flow rate through the reactor produced an increase in the inlet coolant temperature of the reactor core (the coolant no longer having sufficient time to release its heat in the turbine and cooling towers), which now more closely approached the [[nucleate boiling]] temperature of water, reducing the [[factor of safety|safety margin]].\n\nThe flow exceeded the allowed limit at 01:19, triggering an alarm of low steam pressure in the steam separators. At the same time, the extra water flow lowered the overall core temperature and reduced the existing [[void coefficient|steam voids]] in the core and the steam separators.<ref>The RBMK is a boiling water reactor, so in-core boiling is normal at higher power levels. The RBMK design has a negative void coefficient above 700&nbsp;MW.</ref> Since water weakly absorbs neutrons (and the higher density of liquid water makes it a better absorber than steam), turning on additional pumps decreased the reactor power further still. The crew responded by turning off two of the circulation pumps to reduce feedwater flow, in an effort to increase steam pressure, and by removing more manual control rods to maintain power.<ref name=\"OECD02-Ch1\" /><ref>{{cite web | title =Physicians of Chernobyl Association | publisher =Association «Physicians of Chernobyl» | language =Russian | url =http://www.physiciansofchernobyl.org.ua/rus/books/Karpan.html | accessdate = 3 September 2013}}</ref>\n\nAll these actions led to an extremely unstable reactor configuration. Nearly all of the control rods were removed manually, including all but 18 of the \"fail-safe\" manually operated rods of the minimal 28 which were intended to remain fully inserted to control the reactor even in the event of a loss of coolant, out of a total 211 control rods.<ref name=MedvedevG /> While the emergency [[scram|SCRAM]] system that would insert all control rods to shut down the reactor could still be activated manually (through the \"AZ-5\" button), the automated system that could do the same had been disabled to maintain the power level, and many other automated and even passive safety features of the reactor had been bypassed. Further, the reactor coolant pumping had been reduced, which had limited margin so any power excursion would produce boiling, thereby reducing [[neutron absorption]] by the water. The reactor was in an unstable configuration that was outside the safe operating envelope established by the designers. If anything pushed it into supercriticality, it was unable to recover automatically.\n\n===Experiment and explosion===\n{{refimprove section|date=April 2017}}\n[[File:Chernobyl burning-aerial view of core.jpg|thumb|Radioactive steam plumes continued to be generated days after the initial explosion, as evidenced here on 3 May 1986 due to [[decay heat]]. The roof of the turbine hall is damaged (image centre). Roof of the adjacent reactor 3 (image lower left) shows minor fire damage. [[Igor Kostin]] would take some of the clearer pictures of the roof of the buildings when he was physically present on the roof of reactor 3, in June of that year.<ref>[https://www.theguardian.com/environment/gallery/2011/apr/26/chernobyl-nuclear-disaster-in-pictures Guardian Newspaper – Igor Kostin Gallery]</ref>]]\n\nAt 1:23:04&nbsp;a.m., the experiment began. Four of the main circulating pumps (MCP) were active; of the eight total, six are normally active during regular operation. The steam to the turbines was shut off, beginning a run-down of the turbine generator. The diesel generators started and sequentially picked up loads; the generators were to have completely picked up the MCPs' power needs by 01:23:43. In the interim, the power for the MCPs was to be supplied by the turbine generator as it coasted down. As the [[momentum]] of the turbine generator decreased, so did the power it produced for the pumps. The water flow rate decreased, leading to increased formation of steam voids (bubbles) in the core.\n\nBecause of the positive void coefficient of the RBMK reactor at low reactor power levels, it was now primed to embark on a [[positive feedback]] loop, in which the formation of steam voids reduced the ability of the liquid water [[coolant]] to absorb neutrons, which in turn increased the reactor's power output. This caused yet more water to flash into steam, giving a further power increase. During almost the entire period of the experiment the automatic control system successfully counteracted this positive feedback, inserting [[control rod]]s into the reactor core to limit the power rise. This system had control of only 12 rods, and nearly all others had been manually retracted.\n\nAt 1:23:40, as recorded by the [[SKALA]] centralized control system, a [[SCRAM]] (emergency shutdown) of the reactor was initiated. The SCRAM was started when the EPS-5 button (also known as the AZ-5 button) of the reactor emergency protection system was pressed: this engaged the drive mechanism on all control rods to fully insert them, including the manual control rods that had been withdrawn earlier. The reason why the EPS-5 button was pressed is not known, whether it was done as an emergency measure in response to rising temperatures, or simply as a routine method of shutting down the reactor upon completion of the experiment.\n\nThere is a view that the SCRAM may have been ordered as a response to the unexpected rapid power increase, although there is no recorded data proving this. Some have suggested that the button was not manually pressed, that the SCRAM signal was automatically produced by the emergency protection system, but the SKALA registered a manual SCRAM signal. Despite this, the question as to when or even whether the EPS-5 button was pressed has been the subject of debate. There have been assertions that the manual SCRAM was initiated due to the initial rapid power acceleration. Others have suggested that the button was not pressed until the reactor began to self-destruct, while others believe that it happened earlier and in calm conditions.<ref>{{cite book |language=Russian |author1= E.

How did it happen? |chapter= 4}}</ref>\n\nIn any case, when the EPS-5 button was pressed, the insertion of control rods into the reactor core began. The control rod insertion mechanism moved the rods at 0.4&nbsp;m/s, so that the rods took 18 to 20&nbsp;seconds to travel the full height of the [[nuclear reactor core|core]], about 7 metres. A bigger problem was the design of the [[RBMK#Control rods|RBMK control rods]], each of which had a graphite neutron moderator rod attached to the end to boost reactor output by displacing water when the control rod section had been fully withdrawn from the reactor. Thus, when a control rod was at maximum extraction, a neutron-moderating graphite extension was centered in the core with a 1.25 m column of water above and below it. Therefore, injecting a control rod downward into the reactor during a SCRAM initially displaced (neutron-absorbing) water in the lower portion of the reactor with (neutron-moderating) graphite on its way out of the core. As a result, an emergency SCRAM initially increased the reaction rate in the lower part of the core as the graphite section of rods moving out of the reactor displaced water coolant. This behaviour was revealed when the initial insertion of control rods in another RBMK reactor at [[Ignalina Nuclear Power Plant]] in 1983 induced a power spike, but since the subsequent SCRAM of that reactor was successful, the information was disseminated but deemed of little importance.\n\nA few seconds into the SCRAM, a power spike occurred, and the core overheated, causing some of the [[fuel rod]]s to fracture, blocking the control rod columns and jamming the control rods at one-third insertion, with the graphite displacers still in the lower part of the core. Within three seconds the reactor output rose above 530&nbsp;MW.<ref name=\"MedvedevZ\"/>{{rp|31}}\n\nThe subsequent course of events was not registered by instruments; it is known only as a result of mathematical simulation. Apparently, the power spike caused an increase in fuel temperature and steam buildup, leading to a rapid increase in steam pressure. This caused the fuel cladding to fail, releasing the fuel elements into the coolant, and rupturing the channels in which these elements were located.<ref>{{cite web| language =Russian |url=http://www.reactors.narod.ru/pub/chern_2/chern_2.htm |title=Chernobyl as it was – 2}}</ref>\n\nThen, according to some estimations, the reactor jumped to around 30,000&nbsp;MW thermal, ten times the normal operational output. The last reading on the control panel was 33,000&nbsp;MW. It was not possible to reconstruct the precise sequence of the processes that led to the destruction of the reactor and the power unit building, but a [[steam explosion]], like the explosion of a [[steam boiler]] from excess vapour pressure, appears to have been the next event. There is a general understanding that it was explosive steam pressure from the damaged fuel channels escaping into the reactor's exterior cooling structure that caused the explosion that destroyed the reactor casing, tearing off and blasting the upper plate, to which the entire reactor assembly is fastened, through the roof of the reactor building. This is believed to be the first explosion that many heard.<ref>{{cite book |language= Russian |url=http://accidont.ru/Davlet.html |first = RI | last=Davletbaev |title=Last shift Chernobyl.

The total water loss in combination with a high positive void coefficient further increased the reactor's thermal power.\n\nA second, more powerful explosion occurred about two or three seconds after the first; this explosion dispersed the damaged core and effectively terminated the [[nuclear chain reaction]]. This explosion also compromised more of the reactor containment vessel and ejected hot lumps of graphite moderator. The ejected graphite and the demolished channels still in the remains of the reactor vessel caught fire on exposure to air, greatly contributing to the spread of [[radioactive fallout]] and the [[radioactive contamination|contamination]] of outlying areas.<ref name=\"OECD02-Ch1\" />\n\nAccording to observers outside Unit 4, burning lumps of material and sparks shot into the air above the reactor. Some of them fell onto the roof of the machine hall and started a fire. About 25 percent of the red-hot graphite blocks and overheated material from the fuel channels was ejected. Parts of the graphite blocks and fuel channels were out of the reactor building. As a result of the damage to the building an airflow through the core was established by the high temperature of the core. The air ignited the hot graphite and started a graphite fire.<ref name=\"MedvedevZ\"/>{{rp|32}}{{better source|date=October 2016}}\n\nAfter the larger explosion, a number of employees at the power station went outside to get a clearer view of the extent of the damage. One such survivor, [[Individual involvement in the Chernobyl disaster#Yuvchenko|Alexander Yuvchenko]], recounts that once he stopped outside and looked up towards the reactor hall, he saw a \"very beautiful\" [[LASER]]-like beam of [[light blue|light bluish]] light caused by the [[ionized-air glow|ionization of air]] that appeared to \"flood up into [[outer-space|infinity]]\".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ecolo.org/documents/documents_in_english/cherno-alexander_yuvchenko.htm |title=Cheating Chernobyl This interview was first published in New Scientist print edition Source : New Scientist web site}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://pripyat.com/en/articles/chernobyl-20-years.html |title=Chernobyl 20 years on}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.eepublishers.co.za/images/upload/Meyer%20Chernobyl%205.pdf |title=Chernobyl: what happened and why? by CM Meyer, technical journalist |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131211073343/http://www.eepublishers.co.za/images/upload/Meyer%20Chernobyl%205.pdf |archivedate=11 December 2013 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n\nThere were initially several hypotheses about the nature of the second explosion. One view was that the second explosion was caused by [[hydrogen]], which had been produced either by the overheated steam-[[zircaloy|zirconium]] reaction or by the [[Syngas|reaction of red-hot graphite with steam]] that produced hydrogen and [[carbon monoxide]]. Another hypothesis, by Checherov, published in 1998, was that the second explosion was a thermal explosion of the reactor as a result of the uncontrollable escape of [[fast neutron]]s caused by the complete water loss in the reactor core.<ref>{{cite book | language=Russian |last=Checherov |first=K.P. |title= Development of ideas about reasons and processes of emergency on the 4-th unit of Chernobyl NPP 26.04.1986 | publisher= International conference \"Shelter-98\" | location = Slavutich, Ukraine | date = 25–27 November 1998}}</ref> A third hypothesis was that the second explosion was another steam explosion. According to this version, the first explosion was a more minor steam explosion in the circulating loop, causing a loss of coolant flow and pressure that in turn caused the water still in the core to flash to steam. This second explosion then did the majority of the damage to the reactor and containment building.\n\nThe force of the second explosion and the ratio of [[isotopes of xenon|xenon radioisotopes]] released after the accident (a vital tool in [[nuclear forensics]]) indicated to Yuri V. Dubasov in a 2009 publication (suggested before him by Checherov in 1998), that the ''second'' explosion could have been a nuclear power transient resulting from core material melting in the absence of its water coolant and moderator. Dubasov argues that the reactor did not simply undergo a runaway [[Prompt criticality#Nuclear reactors|''delayed''-supercritical/exponential increase in power]] into the multi-gigawatt power range, which is somewhat similar to the conditions of a normal reactor coming up to its commercial power level (with the notable exception that Chernoyl's older RBMK reactor design had the largest positive [[void coefficient of reactivity]] of any reactor then operating commercially), permitting a dangerous \"positive feedback\"/runaway condition, given the lack of [[Passive nuclear safety|''inherent'' safety stops]] when power levels began to increase above the commercial level. Although a positive-feedback power excursion that increased until the reactor disassembled itself by means of its internal energy and external steam explosions<ref>[http://www-pub.iaea.org/MTCD/publications/PDF/Pub913e_web.pdf INSAG 1992. IAEA]</ref> is the more accepted explanation for the cause of the explosions, Dubasov argues instead that a runaway [[prompt criticality|''prompt'' supercriticality]] occurred, with the internal physics being more similar to the explosion of a [[fizzle (nuclear test)|fizzled nuclear weapon]], and that this failed/fizzle event produced the ''second'' explosion.<ref name= Pakhomov2009>{{cite journal |doi=10.1007/s00024-009-0029-9 |title=Estimation of Explosion Energy Yield at Chernobyl NPP Accident |year=2009 |last1=Pakhomov |first1=Sergey A. |last2=Dubasov |first2=Yuri V. |journal=Pure and Applied Geophysics |volume=167 |issue=4–5 |page=575 |bibcode=2010PApGe.167..575P }}</ref>\n\nThis nuclear fizzle hypothesis, then mostly defended by Dubasov, was examined further in 2017 by retired physicist Lars-Erik De Geer in an analysis that puts the hypothesized fizzle event as the more probable cause of the ''first'' explosion.<ref>{{cite journal |url=http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/00295450.2017.1384269 |doi=10.1080/00295450.2017.1384269 |date=November 2017 |work=Nuclear Technology |title=A Nuclear Jet at Chernobyl Around 21:23:45 UTC on April 25, 1986 |first1=Lars-Erik |last1=De Geer |first2=Christer |last2=Persson |first3=Henning |last3=Rodhe |quote=The first explosion consisted of thermal neutron mediated nuclear explosions in one or rather a few fuel channels, which caused a jet of debris that reached an altitude of some 2500 to 3000 m.

During clean-up operations, remotely controlled machinery were used to try to move the most highly radioactive debris, but these failed in the harsh conditions. Consequently, the most highly radioactive materials were shoveled by [[Chernobyl liquidators]] from the military wearing heavy protective gear (dubbed \"bio-robots\" by the military); these soldiers could only spend a maximum of 40&nbsp;seconds working on the rooftops of the surrounding buildings because of the extremely high doses of radiation given off by the blocks of graphite and other debris. Though the soldiers were only supposed to perform the role of the \"bio-robot\" a maximum of once, some soldiers reported having done this task five or six times.  The reactor itself was covered with bags of sand, lead and [[boric acid]] dropped from helicopters: some 5000 metric tons of material were dropped during the week that followed the accident.\n\nAt the time there was still fear that the reactor could re-enter a self-sustaining nuclear chain-reaction and explode again, and a new containment structure was planned to prevent rain entering and triggering such an explosion, and to prevent further release of radioactive material. This was the largest civil engineering task in history, involving a quarter of a million construction workers who all reached their official lifetime limits of radiation.<ref name=\"BBCContaining\"/> By December 1986, a large concrete [[Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant sarcophagus|sarcophagus]] had been erected to seal off the reactor and its contents.<ref>The Social Impact of the Chernobyl Disaster, 1988, p. 166, by David R.

These scientists manually collected cold fuel rods, but great heat was still emanating from the core. Rates of radiation in different parts of the building were monitored by drilling holes into the reactor and inserting long metal detector tubes. The scientists were exposed to high levels of radiation and radioactive dust.<ref name=\"BBCContaining\"/>\n\nAfter six months of investigation, in December 1986, they discovered with the help of a remote camera an intensely radioactive mass in the basement of Unit Four, more than two metres wide and weighing hundreds of tons, which they called \"the elephant's foot\" for its wrinkled appearance.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://nautil.us/blog/chernobyls-hot-mess-the-elephants-foot-is-still-lethal|title=Chernobyl’s Hot Mess, \"the Elephant’s Foot,\" Is Still Lethal\n|date=4 December 2013|work=Nautilus magazine}}</ref> The mass was composed of sand, glass and a large amount of nuclear fuel that had escaped from the reactor.

Indeed, within fifteen months 75% of the land was under cultivation, even though only a third of the evacuated villages were resettled. Defence forces must have done much of the work. Yet this land was of marginal agricultural value.

It effectively placed the blame on the power plant operators. To investigate the causes of the accident the [[IAEA]] created a group known as the [[International Nuclear Safety Group|International Nuclear Safety Advisory Group]] (INSAG), which in its report of 1986, INSAG-1, on the whole also supported this view, based on the data provided by the Soviets and the oral statements of specialists.<ref>IAEA Report INSAG-1 [http://www-ns.iaea.org/committees/insag.asp (International Nuclear Safety Advisory Group)]. Summary Report on the Post-Accident Review on the Chernobyl Accident. Safety Series No. 75-INSAG-1.IAEA, Vienna, 1986.</ref> In this view, the catastrophic accident was caused by gross violations of operating rules and regulations. \"During preparation and testing of the turbine generator under run-down conditions using the auxiliary load, personnel disconnected a series of technical protection systems and breached the most important operational safety provisions for conducting a technical exercise.\"<ref name=atom>{{cite journal |url=http://accidont.ru/expert.html|title=Expert report to the IAEA on the Chernobyl accident |publisher=Atomic Energy |volume= 61 |year=1986|language=ru}}</ref>{{rp|311}}\n\nThe operator error was probably due to their lack of knowledge of [[nuclear reactor physics]] and [[nuclear engineering|engineering]], as well as lack of experience and training. According to these allegations, at the time of the accident the reactor was being operated with many key safety systems turned off, most notably the [[Emergency Core Cooling System]] (ECCS), LAR (Local Automatic control system), and AZ (emergency power reduction system). Personnel had an insufficiently detailed understanding of technical procedures involved with the nuclear reactor, and knowingly ignored regulations to speed test completion.<ref name=\"atom\"/>\n\n{{quote|The developers of the reactor plant considered this combination of events to be impossible and therefore did not allow for the creation of emergency protection systems capable of preventing the combination of events that led to the crisis, namely the intentional disabling of emergency protection equipment plus the violation of operating procedures. Thus the primary cause of the accident was the extremely improbable combination of rule infringement plus the operational routine allowed by the power station staff.<ref name=atom/>{{rp|312}}}}\n\nIn this analysis of the causes of the accident, deficiencies in the reactor design and in the operating regulations that made the accident possible were set aside and mentioned only casually. Serious critical observations covered only general questions and did not address the specific reasons for the accident.\n\nThe following general picture arose from these observations, and several procedural irregularities also helped to make the accident possible, one of which was insufficient communication between the safety officers and the operators in charge of the experiment being run that night.\n\nThe reactor operators disabled safety systems down to the generators, which the test was really about. The main process computer, SKALA, was running in such a way that the main control computer could not shut down the reactor or even reduce power. Normally the computer would have started to insert all of the [[control rods]]. The computer would have also started the \"Emergency Core Protection System\" that introduces 24 control rods into the active zone within 2.5 seconds, which is still slow by 1986 standards. All control was transferred from the process computer to the human operators.\n\nOn the subject of the disconnection of safety systems, Valery Legasov said, in 1987, that \"[i]t was like airplane pilots experimenting with the engines in flight\".<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>\n\nThis view is reflected in numerous publications and also artistic works on the theme of the Chernobyl accident that appeared immediately after the accident,<ref name=MedvedevZ/> and for a long time remained dominant in the public consciousness and in popular publications.\n\n===INSAG-7 Report (1992)===\n[[File:Chaes cz 1-2.jpg|thumb|267px|Reactor hall No. 1 of the Chernobyl Plant]]\n[[File:Chernobyl-LWR-comparison.PNG|thumb|right|267px|A simplified diagram of the major differences between the Chernobyl RBMK and the most common nuclear reactor design, the [[Light water reactor]]. 1.

They document over 29 emergency situations in the plant during this period, 8 of which were caused by negligence or poor competence on the part of personnel.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://tsdea.archives.gov.ua/ru/index_ch.php?page=ch_doc| title=Украина рассекретила документы, касающиеся аварии на Чернобыльской АЭС| accessdate=13 September 2015| deadurl=yes| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151006160927/http://tsdea.archives.gov.ua/ru/index_ch.php?page=ch_doc| archivedate=6 October 2015| df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\nIn 1991 a Commission of the USSR State Committee for the Supervision of Safety in Industry and Nuclear Power reassessed the causes and circumstances of the Chernobyl accident and came to new insights and conclusions. Based on it, in 1992 the IAEA Nuclear Safety Advisory Group (INSAG) published an additional report, INSAG-7,<ref name=insag7/> which reviewed \"that part of the INSAG-1 report in which primary attention is given to the reasons for the accident,\" and was included the USSR State Commission report as Appendix I.<ref name=insag7/>\n\nIn this INSAG report, most of the earlier accusations against staff for breach of regulations were acknowledged to be either erroneous, based on incorrect information obtained in August 1986, or less relevant. This report reflected a different view of the main reasons for the accident, presented in Appendix I. According to this account, the operators' actions in turning off the Emergency Core Cooling System, interfering with the settings on the protection equipment, and blocking the level and pressure in the separator drum did not contribute to the original cause of the accident and its magnitude, although they may have been a breach of regulations. In fact, turning off the emergency system designed to prevent the two turbine generators from stopping was not a violation of regulations.<ref name=insag7/>\n\nHuman factors, however, contributed to the conditions that led to the disaster. These included operating the reactor at a low power level—less than 700&nbsp;MW—a level documented in the run-down test programme, and operating with a small [[Reactivity (nuclear)|operational reactivity margin]] (ORM). The 1986 assertions of Soviet experts notwithstanding, regulations did not prohibit operating the reactor at this low power level.<ref name=insag7>{{cite web |url=http://www-pub.iaea.org/MTCD/publications/PDF/Pub913e_web.pdf |title=IAEA Report INSAG-7 Chernobyl Accident: Updating of INSAG-1 Safety Series, No.75-INSAG-7|publisher=International Atomic Energy Agency|location=Vienna |year=1992}}</ref>{{rp|18}}\n\nHowever, regulations did forbid operating the reactor with a small margin of reactivity. Yet \"post-accident studies have shown that the way in which the real role of the ORM is reflected in the Operating Procedures and design documentation for the RBMK-1000 is extremely contradictory\", and furthermore, \"ORM was not treated as an operational safety limit, violation of which could lead to an accident\".<ref name=insag7/>{{rp|34–25}}\n\nAccording to the INSAG-7 Report, the chief reasons for the accident lie in the peculiarities of physics and in the construction of the reactor. There are two such reasons:<ref name=insag7/>{{rp|18}}\n* The reactor had a dangerously large positive [[void coefficient of reactivity]]. The void coefficient is a measurement of how a reactor responds to increased steam formation in the water coolant. Most other reactor designs have a negative coefficient, i.e. the nuclear reaction rate slows when steam bubbles form in the coolant, since as the vapour phase in the reactor increases, fewer [[neutrons]] are slowed down. [[Fast neutron|Faster neutrons]] are less likely to split [[uranium]] atoms, so the reactor produces less power (a negative feedback). Chernobyl's RBMK reactor, however, used solid [[nuclear graphite|graphite]] as a [[neutron moderator]] to [[thermal neutrons|slow down the neutrons]], and the water in it, on the contrary, acts like a harmful [[neutron absorber]]. Thus neutrons are slowed down even if steam bubbles form in the water. Furthermore, because steam [[neutron capture|absorbs neutrons]] much less readily than water, increasing the intensity of vaporization means that more neutrons are able to split uranium atoms, increasing the reactor's power output. This makes the RBMK design very unstable at low power levels, and prone to suddenly increasing energy production to a dangerous level. This behaviour is [[counter-intuitive]], and this property of the reactor was unknown to the crew.\n* A more significant flaw was in the design of the [[control rods]] that are inserted into the reactor to slow down the reaction. In the RBMK reactor design, the lower part of each control rod was made of graphite and was 1.3 metres shorter than necessary, and in the space beneath the rods were hollow channels filled with water. The upper part of the rod, the truly functional part that absorbs the neutrons and thereby halts the reaction, was made of [[boron carbide]]. With this design, when the rods are inserted into the reactor from the uppermost position, the graphite parts initially displace some water (which absorbs neutrons, as mentioned above), effectively causing fewer neutrons to be absorbed initially. Thus for the first few seconds of control rod activation, reactor power output is increased, rather than reduced as desired. This behaviour is counter-intuitive and was not known to the reactor operators.\n* Other deficiencies besides these were noted in the RBMK-1000 reactor design, as were its non-compliance with accepted standards and with the requirements of nuclear reactor safety.\n\nWhile INSAG-1 and INSAG-7 reports both identified operator error as an issue of concern, the INSAG-7 identified that there were numerous other issues that were contributing factors that led to the incident.  These contributing factors include:<ref>[http://www-pub.iaea.org/MTCD/publications/PDF/Pub913e_web.pdf INSAG-7 The Chernobyl Accident: Updating of INSAG-1]</ref>\n* The plant was not designed to safety standards in effect and incorporated unsafe features\n* \"Inadequate safety analysis\" was performed\n* There was \"insufficient attention to independent safety review\"\n* \"Operating  procedures not founded satisfactorily in safety analysis\"\n* Safety information not adequately and effectively communicated between operators, and between operators and designers\n* The operators did not adequately understand safety aspects of the plant\n* Operators did not sufficiently respect formal requirements of operational and test procedures\n* The regulatory regime was insufficient to effectively counter pressures for production\n* There was a \"general lack of safety culture in nuclear matters at the national level as well as locally\"\n\n===Analysis of views===\nBoth views were heavily [[lobbied]] by different groups, including the reactor's designers, power plant personnel, and the Soviet and Ukrainian governments. According to the IAEA's 1986 analysis, the main cause of the accident was the operators' actions. But according to the IAEA's 1993 revised analysis the main cause was the reactor's design.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.insc.anl.gov/neisb/neisb4/NEISB_3.3.A1.html |title=NEI Source Book: Fourth Edition (NEISB_3.3.A1) |publisher=Insc.anl.gov |accessdate=31 July 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://timetravel.mementoweb.org/memento/2011/http://www.insc.anl.gov/neisb/neisb4/NEISB_3.3.A1.html |archivedate=2 July 2016 |df=dmy }}</ref> One reason there were such contradictory viewpoints and so much debate about the causes of the Chernobyl accident was that the primary data covering the disaster, as registered by the instruments and sensors, were not completely published in the official sources.\n\nOnce again, the [[human factor]] had to be considered as a major element in causing the accident. INSAG notes that both the operating regulations and staff handled the disabling of the reactor protection easily enough: witness the length of time for which the ECCS was out of service while the reactor was operated at half power. INSAG's view is that it was the operating crew's deviation from the test programme that was mostly to blame. \"Most reprehensibly, unapproved changes in the test procedure were deliberately made on the spot, although the plant was known to be in a very different condition from that intended for the test.\"<ref name=insag7/>{{rp|24}}\n\nAs in the previously released report INSAG-1, close attention is paid in report INSAG-7 to the inadequate (at the moment of the accident) \"culture of safety\" at all levels. Deficiency in the safety culture was inherent not only at the operational stage but also, and to no lesser extent, during activities at other stages in the lifetime of nuclear power plants (including design, engineering, construction, manufacture, and regulation). The poor quality of operating procedures and instructions, and their conflicting character, put a heavy burden on the operating crew, including the chief engineer. \"The accident can be said to have flowed from a deficient safety culture, not only at the Chernobyl plant, but throughout the Soviet design, operating and regulatory organizations for nuclear power that existed at that time.\"<ref name=\"insag7\"/>{{rp|24}}\n\n==Environmental effects==\n{{Main|Chernobyl disaster effects}}\n\n===National and international spread of radioactive substances===\n\nAlthough no informing comparisons can be made between the accident and a strictly [[air burst]]-fuzed nuclear detonation, it has still been approximated that about four hundred times more radioactive material was released from Chernobyl than by the [[Atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki|atomic bombing of Hiroshima and Nagasaki]]. By contrast the Chernobyl accident released about one hundredth to one thousandth of the total amount of radioactivity released during the era of [[nuclear weapons testing]] at the height of the Cold War, 1950 – 1960s, with the 1/100 to 1/1000 variance due to trying to make comparisons with different spectrums of isotopes released.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.iaea.org/Publications/Booklets/Chernoten/facts.html |work=Ten years after Chernobyl : What do we really know? |title=Facts: The accident was by far the most devastating in the history of nuclear power |publisher=International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) |date=21 September 1997 |accessdate=20 August 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110805035908/http://www.iaea.org/Publications/Booklets/Chernoten/facts.html |archivedate=5 August 2011 |df=dmy-all }}</ref> Approximately 100,000&nbsp;km² of land was significantly contaminated with fallout, with the worst hit regions being in Belarus, Ukraine and Russia.<ref name=\"MarplesDecade\">{{cite journal | last = Marples | first = David R. | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=xAwAAAAAMBAJ&lpg=PA20&pg=PA20#v=onepage&q&f=false | title = The Decade of Despair | journal = The Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists | date = May–June 1996 | volume = 52 | pages = 20–31 | issue = 3}}</ref> Slighter levels of contamination were detected over all of Europe except for the [[Iberian Peninsula]].<ref name=torch/><ref name=\"RFI 24\">{{Cite news|language=French| title=Tchernobyl, 20 ans après|publisher=[[Radio France Internationale|RFI]]|date=24 April 2006|accessdate=24 April 2006|url=http://www.rfi.fr/actufr/articles/076/article_43250.asp}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|language=French|title=L'accident et ses conséquences: Le panache radioactif |trans-title=The accident and its consequences: The plume|publisher=Institut de Radioprotection et de Sûreté Nucléaire (IRSN)|accessdate=16 December 2006|url=http://www.irsn.fr/FR/popup/Pages/tchernobyl_animation_nuage.aspx}}</ref>\n\nThe initial evidence that a major release of radioactive material was affecting other countries came not from Soviet sources, but from Sweden.

The report mentioned the possibility that the repaired part of the turbine-building added a larger strain on the total structure than expected, and the braces in the roof were damaged by corrosion and sloppy welding. Experts such as Valentin Kupny, former deputy director of the nuclear plant, did warn that the complex was on the verge of a collapse, leaving the building in an extremely dangerous condition. A proposed reinforcement in 2005 was cancelled by a superior official. After the 12 February incident, radioactivity levels were up to 19 becquerels per cubic meter of air: 12 times normal. The report assumed radioactive materials from inside the structure spread to the surroundings after the roof collapsed. All 225 workers employed by the Chernobyl complex and the French company that is building the new shelter were evacuated shortly after the collapse. According to the managers of the complex, radiation levels around the plant were at normal levels (between 5 and 6&nbsp;µSv/h) and should not affect workers' health.

The plan calls for transforming the site into an ecologically safe condition by means of stabilization of the sarcophagus followed by construction of a New Safe Confinement (NSC). While the original cost estimate for the SIP was US$768&nbsp;million, the 2006 estimate was $1.2&nbsp;billion. The SIP is being managed by a consortium of [[Bechtel]], [[Battelle Memorial Institute|Battelle]], and [[Électricité de France]], and conceptual design for the NSC consists of a movable arch, constructed away from the shelter to avoid high radiation, to be slid over the sarcophagus. The NSC was moved into position in November 2016 and is expected to be completed in late 2017,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ebrd.com/what-we-do/sectors/nuclear-safety/chernobyl-new-safe-confinement.html |title=Chernobyl’s New Safe Confinement|accessdate=26 October 2017 |df=dmy }}</ref> and is the largest movable structure ever built.\n\nDimensions:\n* Span: {{convert|270|m|ft|0|abbr=on}}\n* Height: {{convert|100|m|ft|-1|abbr=on}}\n* Length: {{convert|150|m|ft|0|abbr=on}}\n\n===The United Nations Development Programme===\nThe [[United Nations Development Programme]] has launched in 2003 a specific project called the [[Chernobyl Recovery and Development Programme]] (CRDP) for the recovery of the affected areas.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.undp.org.ua/?page=projects&projects=14 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070704002250/http://www.undp.org.ua/?page=projects&projects=14 |dead-url=yes |archive-date=4 July 2007 |title=CRDP: Chernobyl Recovery and Development Programme (United Nations Development Programme) |publisher=Undp.org.ua |accessdate=31 July 2010 }}</ref> The programme was initiated in February 2002 based on the recommendations in the report on Human Consequences of the Chernobyl Nuclear Accident. The main goal of the CRDP's activities is supporting the [[Government of Ukraine]] in mitigating long-term social, economic, and ecological consequences of the Chernobyl catastrophe. CRDP works in the four most Chernobyl-affected areas in Ukraine: [[Kyivska]], [[Zhytomyr Oblast|Zhytomyrska]], [[Chernihiv Oblast|Chernihivska]] and [[Rivnenska]].\n\n===The International Project on the Health Effects of the Chernobyl Accident===\nThe International Project on the Health Effects of the Chernobyl Accident (IPEHCA) was created and received [[US $]]20&nbsp;million, mainly from Japan, in hopes of discovering the main cause of health problems due to <sup>131</sup>I radiation. These funds were divided among Ukraine, Belarus, and Russia, the three main affected countries, for further investigation of health effects. As there was significant corruption in former Soviet countries, most of the foreign aid was given to Russia, and no positive outcome from this money has been demonstrated.{{Citation needed|date=March 2011}}\n\n===Chernobyl Children International===\n[[Chernobyl Children International]] (CCI) is a [[United Nations]]-accredited,{{citation needed|date=July 2017}} [[non-profit]], international development, medical, and humanitarian organization that works with children, families and communities that continue to be affected by the economic outcome of the Chernobyl accident. The organization's founder and chief executive is [[Adi Roche]]. The CCI was founded in 1991 in response to an appeal from [[Ukraine|Ukrainian]] and [[Belarus]]ian doctors for aid. Roche then began organizing 'rest and recuperation' holidays for a few Chernobyl children. Recruiting Irish families who would welcome and care for them, CCI expanded into the [[United States]] in 2001.<ref name=bbcroche>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/12750.stm Adi Roche – the early favourite], ''BBC News'', 29 October 1997.</ref><ref name=wcahon>[http://www.worldofchildren.org/honoree/adi-roche/ The 2015 World of Children Award Honorees]</ref>\n\nIt works closely with the Belarusian government, the [[United Nations]], and many thousands of volunteers worldwide to deliver a broad range of economic supports to the children and the wider community.

Because of the distrust that many people (both within and outside the [[Soviet Union|USSR]]) had in the Soviet authorities, a great deal of debate about the situation at the site occurred in the [[First World]] during the early days of the event. Because of defective [[intelligence (information gathering)|intelligence]] based on [[satellite imagery|photographs taken from space]], it was thought that unit number three had also suffered a dire accident.{{citation needed|date=May 2013}}\n\nJournalists mistrusted many professionals (such as the spokesman from the UK [[NRPB]]), and they in turn encouraged the public to mistrust them.<ref name=\"kasperson160\"/>\n\nIn Italy, the Chernobyl accident was reflected in the outcome of the [[Italian nuclear power referendum, 1987|1987 referendum]]. As a result of that referendum, Italy began phasing out its nuclear power plants in 1988, a decision that was effectively [[Nuclear power in Italy|reversed in 2008]]. A [[Italian referendums, 2011#Nuclear power|referendum in 2011]] reiterated Italians' strong objections to nuclear power, thus abrogating the government's decision of 2008.\n\nIn Germany, the Chernobyl accident led to the creation of a federal environment ministry, after several states had already created such a post. The minister was given the authority over reactor safety as well, which the current minister still holds as of 2015. The events are also credited with strengthening the anti-nuclear power movement, which culminated in the decision to end the use of nuclear power that was made by the 1998–2005 Schröder government.\n\n==See also==\n{{Div col|colwidth=30em}}\n* [[Chernobyl New Safe Confinement]]\n* [[Children of Chernobyl Benefit Concert]]\n* [[Comparison of Chernobyl and other radioactivity releases]]\n* [[Convention on Assistance in the Case of a Nuclear Accident or Radiological Emergency]] – An IAEA treaty created due to the accident.\n* [[Convention on Early Notification of a Nuclear Accident]]\n* [[Environmental racism in Europe]]\n* [[List of Chernobyl-related articles]]\n* [[Seconds From Disaster#Episodes|National Geographic ''Seconds From Disaster'' episodes]]\n* [[Threat of the Dnieper reservoirs]]\n* [[Nuclear energy policy of the United States#Public opinion after Chernobyl|US public opinion on nuclear energy policy after Chernobyl]]\n{{div col end}}\n\n==Notes==\n{{Reflist|group=note}}\n\n==References==\n'''Explanatory notes'''\n{{reflist|group=notes}}\n\n'''Citations'''\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n'''Sources'''\n\nThe source documents relating to the emergency, published in unofficial sources:\n* [http://accidont.ru/archive/Reglament.pdf Technological Regulations on operation of 3 and 4 power units of Chernobyl NPP] (in force at the moment of emergency)\n* [http://accidont.ru/ENG/datas.html Tables and graphs of some parameters variation of the unit before the emergency]\n\n==Further reading==\n{{refbegin|30em}}\n* {{Cite book|last=Abbott|first=Pamela|title=Chernobyl: Living With Risk and Uncertainty|publisher=Health, Risk & Society 8.2|year=2006|pages=105–121}}\n* {{Cite book|last=Cohen|first=Bernard Leonard|authorlink=Bernard Cohen (physicist)|title=The Nuclear Energy Option: An Alternative for the 90's|publisher=Plenum Press|year=1990|isbn=978-0-306-43567-6|chapter=(7) The Chernobyl accident&nbsp;– can it happen here?}}\n* {{Cite book|last=Dyatlov|first=Anatoly|authorlink=Anatoly Dyatlov|title=Chernobyl.

Several independent groups also conducted studies. The approximately 2 million people around TMI-2 during the accident are estimated to have received an average radiation dose of only about 1 millirem above the usual background dose. To put this into context, exposure from a chest X-ray is about 6 millirem and the area's natural radioactive background dose is about 100-125 millirem per year for the area. The accident's maximum dose to a person at the site boundary would have been less than 100 millirem above background.  In the months following the accident, although questions were raised about possible adverse effects from radiation on human, animal, and plant life in the TMI area, none could be directly correlated to the accident. Thousands of environmental samples of air, water, milk, vegetation, soil, and foodstuffs were collected by various government agencies monitoring the area. Very low levels of radionuclides could be attributed to releases from the accident. However, comprehensive investigations and assessments by several well respected organizations, such as Columbia University and the University of Pittsburgh, have concluded that in spite of serious damage to the reactor, the actual release had negligible effects on the physical health of individuals or the environment.}}</ref> Cleanup started in August 1979, and officially ended in December 1993, with a total cleanup cost of about $1&nbsp;billion.<ref name=\"nytimes1993\">{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1993/08/15/us/14-year-cleanup-at-three-mile-island-concludes.html |title=14-Year Cleanup at Three Mile Island Concludes |publisher=New York Times |date=August 15, 1993 |accessdate=March 28, 2011}}</ref>\n\n== Accident ==\n\n===Stuck valve===\n[[File:Tmi-2 schematic.svg|right|thumb|500px|Simplified schematic diagram of the TMI-2 plant<ref name=\"FactSheet\">{{cite web |url=https://www.nrc.gov/reading-rm/doc-collections/fact-sheets/3mile-isle.html |title=Fact Sheet on the Three Mile Island Accident |publisher=[[U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission]] |accessdate=November 25, 2008}}</ref>]]\n\nIn the nighttime hours preceding the incident, the TMI-2 reactor was running at 97% of full power, while the companion TMI-1 reactor was shut down for refueling.<ref>Walker, p. 71.</ref> The main chain of events leading to the partial core meltdown began at 4:37&nbsp;am EST on March 28, 1979, in TMI-2's secondary loop, one of the three main water/steam loops in a [[pressurized water reactor]] (PWR).\n\nThe initial cause of the accident happened eleven hours earlier, during an attempt by operators to fix a blockage in one of the eight [[condensate polisher]]s, the sophisticated filters cleaning the secondary loop water. These filters are designed to stop minerals and impurities in the water from accumulating in the steam generators and increasing corrosion rates in the secondary side.\n\nBlockages are common with these resin filters and are usually fixed easily, but in this case the usual method of forcing the stuck resin out with compressed air did not succeed. The operators decided to blow the compressed air into the water and let the force of the water clear the resin. When they forced the resin out, a small amount of water forced its way past a stuck-open check valve and found its way into an instrument air line. This would eventually cause the [[feedwater pump]]s, condensate booster pumps, and condensate pumps to turn off around 4:00&nbsp;am, which would in turn cause a [[Steam turbine#Speed regulation|turbine trip]].<ref>INPO ICES Report #4810 (Three Mile Island Unit 2) Small Break LOCA Results in Core Damage.</ref>\n\nWith the [[steam generator (nuclear power)|steam generators]] no longer receiving feedwater, heat and pressure increased in the reactor coolant system, causing the reactor to perform an [[scram|emergency shutdown]] (SCRAM). Within eight seconds, [[control rod]]s were inserted into the core to halt the [[nuclear chain reaction]]. The reactor continued to generate [[decay heat]] and, because steam was no longer being used by the turbine, heat was no longer being removed from the reactor's primary water loop.<ref>Walker, pp. 72–73.</ref>\n\nOnce the secondary feedwater pumps stopped, three auxiliary pumps activated automatically. However, because the valves had been closed for routine maintenance, the system was unable to pump any water. The closure of these valves was a violation of a key [[Nuclear Regulatory Commission]] (NRC) rule, according to which the reactor must be shut down if all auxiliary feed pumps are closed for maintenance. This was later singled out by NRC officials as a key failure.<ref name=postch1>{{cite web\n | url =https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/national/longterm/tmi/stories/ch1.htm\n | title =A Pump Failure and Claxon Alert\n | last1 = \n | first1 = \n | year = 1979\n | website =  www.washingtonpost.com\n | publisher = The Washington Post Company\n | dead-url = \n | access-date = 4 September 2016\n | quote = Apparently the valves were closed for routine maintenance, in violation of one of the most stringent rules that the Nuclear Regulatory Commission has. The rule states simply that auxiliary feed pumps can never all be down for maintenance while the reactor is running.}}</ref>\n\nThe loss of heat removal from the primary loop and the failure of the auxiliary system to activate caused the primary loop pressure to increase, triggering the [[pilot-operated relief valve]]  at the top of the [[pressurizer]]{{spaced ndash}}a pressure active-regulator tank{{spaced ndash}}to open automatically. The relief valve should have closed when the excess pressure had been released, and electric power to the [[solenoid]] of the pilot was automatically cut, but the relief valve stuck open because of a mechanical fault. The open valve permitted coolant water to escape from the primary system, and was the principal mechanical cause of the primary coolant system depressurization and partial core disintegration that followed.<ref>Walker, pp. 73–74.</ref>\n\n===Human factors: confusion over valve status===\nCritical [[human factor]]s and [[user interface engineering]] problems were revealed in the investigation of the reactor [[Process control|control]] system's [[user interface]]. Despite the valve being stuck open, a light on the control panel ostensibly indicated that the valve was ''closed''. In fact the light did not indicate the position of the valve, only the status of the solenoid being powered or not, thus giving false evidence of a closed valve.<ref>{{cite book|last=Norman|first=Donald|authorlink=Donald Norman|title=[[The Design of Everyday Things]]|publisher=[[Basic Books]]|location=New York|year=1988|isbn=978-0-465-06710-7|pages=43–44}}</ref> As a result, the operators did not correctly diagnose the problem for several hours.<ref>Rogovin, pp. 14–15.</ref>\n\nThe design of the pilot-operated relief valve indicator light was fundamentally flawed. The bulb was simply connected in parallel with the valve [[solenoid]], thus implying that the pilot-operated relief valve was shut when it went dark, without actually verifying the real position of the valve. When everything was operating correctly, the indication was true and the operators became habituated to rely on it. However, when things went wrong and the main relief valve stuck open, the unlighted lamp was actually misleading the operators by implying that the valve was shut. This caused the operators considerable confusion, because the pressure, temperature and coolant levels in the primary circuit, so far as they could observe them via their instruments, were not behaving as they would have if the pilot-operated relief valve were shut. This confusion contributed to the severity of the accident because the operators were unable to break out of a cycle of assumptions that conflicted with what their instruments were telling them. The problem was not correctly diagnosed until a fresh shift came in who did not have the mindset of the first shift of operators. By this time major damage had occurred.\n\nThe operators had not been trained to understand the ambiguous nature of the pilot-operated relief valve indicator and to look for alternative confirmation that the main relief valve was closed. There was a temperature indicator downstream of the pilot-operated relief valve in the tail pipe between the pilot-operated relief valve and the pressurizer that could have told them the valve was stuck open, by showing that the temperature in the tail pipe remained higher than it should have been had the pilot-operated relief valve been shut. This temperature indicator, however, was not part of the \"safety grade\" suite of indicators designed to be used after an incident, and the operators had not been trained to use it. Its location on the back of the seven-foot-high instrument panel also meant that it was effectively out of sight of the operators.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Walker|first1=J. Samuel|authorlink1=J. Samuel Walker|title=Three Mile Island : a nuclear crisis in historical perspective|date=2004|publisher=University of California Press|location=Berkeley, Calif. ; London|isbn=9780520239401|page=74}}</ref>\n\n===Consequences of stuck valve===\nAs the pressure in the primary system continued to decrease, reactor coolant continued to flow, but it was boiling inside the core. First, small bubbles of steam formed and immediately collapsed, known as [[nucleate boiling]]. As the system pressure decreased further, steam pockets began to form in the reactor coolant. This departure from nucleate boiling (DNB) into the regime of \"film boiling\" caused steam voids in coolant channels, blocking the flow of liquid coolant and greatly increasing the fuel cladding temperature. The overall water level inside the pressurizer was ''rising'' despite the loss of coolant through the open pilot-operated relief valve, as the volume of these steam voids increased much more quickly than coolant was lost. Because of the lack of a dedicated instrument to measure the level of water in the core, operators judged the level of water in the core solely by the level in the pressurizer. Since it was high, they assumed that the core was properly covered with coolant, unaware that because of steam forming in the reactor vessel, the indicator provided misleading readings.<ref>Kemeny, p. 94.</ref> Indications of high water levels contributed to the confusion, as operators were concerned about the primary loop \"going solid,\" (i.e. no steam pocket buffer existing in the pressurizer) which in training they had been instructed to never allow. This confusion was a key contributor to the initial failure to recognize the accident as a [[loss-of-coolant accident]], and led operators to turn off the emergency core cooling pumps, which had automatically started after the pilot-operated relief valve stuck and core coolant loss began, due to fears the system was being overfilled.<ref>Rogovin, p. 16, Walker, pp. 76–77.</ref>\n\nWith the pilot-operated relief valve still open, the pressurizer relief tank that collected the discharge from the pilot-operated relief valve overfilled, causing the containment building [[sump]] to fill and sound an alarm at 4:11&nbsp;am. This alarm, along with higher than normal temperatures on the pilot-operated relief valve discharge line and unusually high containment building temperatures and pressures, were clear indications that there was an ongoing loss-of-coolant accident, but these indications were initially ignored by operators.<ref>Kemeny, p. 96; Rogovin, pp. 17–18.</ref> At 4:15&nbsp;am, the relief diaphragm of the pressurizer relief tank ruptured, and radioactive coolant began to leak out into the general [[containment building]]. This radioactive coolant was pumped from the [[containment building]] sump to an auxiliary building, outside the main containment, until the [[sump pump]]s were stopped at 4:39&nbsp;am.<ref>Kemeny, p. 96.</ref>\n\nAfter almost 80&nbsp;minutes of slow temperature rise, the primary loop's four main reactor coolant pumps began to [[cavitation|cavitate]] as a steam bubble/water mixture, rather than water, passed through them. The pumps were shut down, and it was believed that natural circulation would continue the water movement. Steam in the system prevented flow through the core, and as the water stopped circulating it was converted to steam in increasing amounts. About 130&nbsp;minutes after the first malfunction, the top of the reactor core was exposed and the intense heat caused a reaction to occur between the steam forming in the reactor core and the [[Zircaloy]] [[nuclear fuel rod]] [[Clad (metallurgy)|cladding]], yielding [[zirconium dioxide]], [[hydrogen]], and additional heat. This reaction melted the nuclear fuel rod cladding and damaged the fuel pellets, which released radioactive isotopes to the reactor coolant, and produced hydrogen gas that is believed to have caused a small explosion in the containment building later that afternoon.<ref>Kemeny, p. 99.</ref>\n\n[[File:Graphic TMI-2 Core End-State Configuration.png|thumb|left|300px|NRC graphic of TMI-2 core end-state configuration.]]\n\nAt 6&nbsp;am, there was a shift change in the control room. A new arrival noticed that the temperature in the pilot-operated relief valve tail pipe and the holding tanks was excessive and used a backup valve{{spaced ndash}}called a \"block valve\"{{spaced ndash}}to shut off the coolant venting via the pilot-operated relief valve, but around {{convert|32000|USgal|l|abbr=on}} of coolant had already leaked from the primary loop.<ref>Rogovin, p. 19; Walker, p. 78.</ref> It was not until 165 minutes after the start of the problem that radiation alarms activated as contaminated water reached detectors; by that time, the radiation levels in the primary coolant water were around 300&nbsp;times expected levels, and the general containment building was seriously contaminated.\n\n==Emergency declared==\nAt 6:57&nbsp;am, a plant supervisor declared a [[Nuclear safety in the United States#Emergency Classifications|site area emergency]], and less than 30&nbsp;minutes later station manager Gary Miller announced a general emergency, defined as having the \"potential for serious radiological consequences\" to the general public.<ref>Walker, p. 79.</ref> [[FirstEnergy|Metropolitan Edison]] (Met Ed) notified the [[Pennsylvania Emergency Management Agency]] (PEMA), which in turn contacted state and local agencies, [[Governor of Pennsylvania|Governor]] [[Richard L. Thornburgh]] and [[Lieutenant Governor of Pennsylvania|lieutenant governor]] [[William Scranton III]], to whom Thornburgh assigned responsibility for collecting and reporting on information about the accident.<ref>Walker, pp. 80–81.</ref> The uncertainty of operators at the plant was reflected in fragmentary, ambiguous, or contradictory statements made by Met Ed to government agencies and to the press, particularly about the possibility and severity of off-site radioactivity releases. Scranton held a press conference in which he was reassuring, yet confusing, about this possibility, stating that though there had been a \"small release of radiation...no increase in normal radiation levels\" had been detected. These were contradicted by another official, and by statements from Met Ed, who both claimed that no radioactivity had been released.<ref>Walker, pp. 80–84.</ref> In fact, readings from instruments at the plant and off-site detectors had detected radioactivity releases, albeit at levels that were unlikely to threaten public health as long as they were temporary, and providing that containment of the then highly contaminated reactor was maintained.<ref>Walker, pp. 84–86.</ref>\n\nAngry that Met Ed had not informed them before conducting a steam venting from the plant, and convinced that the company was downplaying the severity of the accident, state officials turned to the [[Nuclear Regulatory Commission|NRC]].<ref>Walker, p. 87.</ref> After receiving word of the accident from Met Ed, the NRC had activated its emergency response headquarters in [[Bethesda, Maryland]] and sent staff members to Three Mile Island. NRC chairman [[Joseph Hendrie]] and commissioner Victor Gilinsky<ref>[https://www.nrc.gov/about-nrc/organization/commission/former-commissioners/gilinsky.html NRC: Victor Gilinsky]</ref> initially viewed the accident, in the words of NRC historian Samuel Walker, as a \"cause for concern but not alarm\".<ref>Walker, p. 89.</ref> Gilinsky briefed reporters and members of Congress on the situation and informed White House staff, and at 10:00&nbsp;a.m. met with two other commissioners. However, the NRC faced the same problems in obtaining accurate information as the state, and was further hampered by being organizationally ill-prepared to deal with emergencies, as it lacked a clear [[command structure]] and the authority to tell the utility what to do, or to order an evacuation of the local area.<ref>Walker, pp. 90–91.</ref>\n\nIn a 2009 article, Gilinsky wrote that it took five weeks to learn that \"the reactor operators had measured fuel temperatures near the melting point\".<ref name=Gilinsky2009>{{cite journal\n |last=Gilinsky \n |first=Victor\n |title=Behind the scenes of Three Mile Island\n |journal=[[Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists]]\n |date=March 23, 2009\n |url=http://thebulletin.org/web-edition/features/behind-the-scenes-of-three-mile-island\n |accessdate=March 31, 2009\n |deadurl=yes\n |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090815015736/http://thebulletin.org/web-edition/features/behind-the-scenes-of-three-mile-island\n |archivedate=August 15, 2009 }}</ref> He further wrote: \"We didn't learn for years{{spaced ndash}}until the reactor vessel was physically opened{{spaced ndash}}that by the time the plant operator called the NRC at about 8:00&nbsp;a.m., roughly half of the uranium fuel had already melted.\"<ref name=\"Gilinsky2009\"/>\n\nIt was still not clear to the control room staff that the primary loop water levels were low and that over half of the core was exposed. A group of workers took manual readings from the [[thermocouple]]s and obtained a sample of primary loop water. Seven hours into the emergency, new water was pumped into the primary loop and the backup relief valve was opened to reduce pressure so that the loop could be filled with water. After 16&nbsp;hours the primary loop pumps were turned on once again, and the core temperature began to fall. A large part of the core had [[Nuclear meltdown|melted]], and the system was still dangerously radioactive.\n\nOn the third day following the accident, a hydrogen bubble was discovered in the dome of the pressure vessel, and became the focus of concern. A hydrogen explosion might not only breach the pressure vessel, but, depending on its magnitude, might compromise the integrity of the containment vessel leading to large-scale release of radioactive material. However, it was determined that there was no oxygen present in the pressure vessel, a prerequisite for hydrogen to burn or explode. Immediate steps were taken to reduce the hydrogen bubble, and by the following day it was significantly smaller. Over the next week, steam and hydrogen were removed from the reactor using a [[Catalyst#Heterogeneous catalysts|catalytic]] recombiner and, controversially, by venting straight to the [[Earth's atmosphere|atmosphere]].\n\n===Release of radioactive material===\nThe release occurred when the cladding was damaged while the pilot-operated relief valve was still stuck open. Fission products were released into the reactor coolant. Since the pilot-operated relief valve was stuck open and the loss of coolant accident was still in progress, primary coolant with fission products and/or fuel was released, and ultimately ended up in the auxiliary building. The auxiliary building was outside the containment boundary.\n\nThis was evidenced by the radiation alarms that eventually sounded. However, since very little of the fission products released were solids at room temperature, very little [[radiological contamination]] was reported in the environment. No significant level of radiation was attributed to the TMI-2 accident outside of the TMI-2 facility. According to the Rogovin report, the vast majority of the radioisotopes released were the noble gases xenon and krypton. The report stated, \"During the course of the accident, approximately {{convert|2.5|MCi|abbr=on}} of radioactive noble gases and {{convert|15|Ci|abbr=on}} of radioiodines were released.\" This resulted in an average dose of {{convert|1.4|mrem|uSv|abbr=on}} to the two million people near the plant. The report compared this with the additional {{convert|80|mrem|uSv|abbr=on}} per year received from living in a high altitude city such as Denver.<ref>Rogovin, pp. 25, 153.</ref> As further comparison, a patient receives {{convert|3.2|mrem|uSv|abbr=on}} from a chest X-ray – more than twice the average dose of those received near the plant.<ref>http://www.physics.isu.edu/radinf/risk.htm</ref>  Measures of beta radiation were excluded from the report.\n\nWithin hours of the accident, the [[United States Environmental Protection Agency]] (EPA) began daily sampling of the environment at the three stations closest to the plant. Continuous monitoring at 11&nbsp;stations was not established until April 1, and was expanded to 31 stations on April 3. An inter-agency analysis concluded that the accident did not raise radioactivity far enough above background levels to cause even one additional cancer death among the people in the area, but measures of beta radiation were not included. The EPA found no contamination in water, soil, sediment or plant samples.<ref name=\"EPA's Role at Three Mile Island\">[http://www.epa.gov/history/topics/tmi/02.htm EPA's Role At Three Mile Island | EPA History | US EPA].

The first major phase of the cleanup was completed in 1990, when workers finished shipping {{convert|150|ST|t|abbr=on}} of radioactive wreckage to Idaho for storage at the Department of Energy's National Engineering Laboratory. However, the contaminated cooling water that leaked into the containment building had seeped into the building's concrete, leaving the radioactive residue too impractical to remove. In 1988, the Nuclear Regulatory Commission announced that, although it was possible to further decontaminate the Unit&nbsp;2 site, the remaining radioactivity had been sufficiently contained as to pose no threat to public health and safety. Accordingly, further cleanup efforts were deferred to allow for decay of the radiation levels and to take advantage of the potential economic benefits of retiring both Unit&nbsp;1 and Unit&nbsp;2 together.<ref name= \"nytimes1993\"/>\n\n===Health effects and epidemiology===\n{{main|Three Mile Island accident health effects}}\nIn the aftermath of the accident, investigations focused on the amount of radioactivity released by the accident.

TMI was an example of this type of accident because it was \"unexpected, incomprehensible, uncontrollable and unavoidable.\"<ref>Perrow, C. (1982), 'The President's Commission and the Normal Accident', in Sils, D., Wolf, C. and Shelanski, V. (Eds), Accident at Three Mile Island: The Human Dimensions, Westview, Boulder, pp. 173–184.</ref>\n\n<blockquote>Perrow concluded that the failure at Three Mile Island was a consequence of the system's immense complexity. Such modern high-risk systems, he realized, were prone to failures however well they were managed. It was inevitable that they would eventually suffer what he termed a 'normal accident'. Therefore, he suggested, we might do better to contemplate a radical redesign, or if that was not possible, to abandon such technology entirely.<ref name=nature477>{{cite web |url= |title=In retrospect:Normal accidents |author=Nick Pidgeon |date=September 22, 2011|volume=477 |work=Nature }}</ref> </blockquote>\n\n\"Normal\" accidents, or [[system accident]]s, are so-called by Perrow because such accidents are inevitable in extremely complex systems. Given the characteristic of the system involved, multiple failures which interact with each other will occur, despite efforts to avoid them.<ref>Perrow, Charles. ''Normal Accidents: Living with High-Risk Technologies'' New York: Basic Books, 1984. p. 5.</ref>  Such events appear trivial to begin with before unpredictably cascading through the system to create a large event with severe consequences.<ref name=rev>{{cite web |url=http://esd.mit.edu/WPS/wplit-2003-01.pdf |title=Normal Accidents by Charles Perrow |author=Daniel E Whitney  |year=2003 |work=Massachusetts Institute of Technology }}</ref>\n\n<blockquote>''Normal Accidents'' contributed key concepts to a set of intellectual developments in the 1980s that revolutionized the conception of safety and risk. It made the case for examining technological failures as the product of highly interacting systems, and highlighted organizational and management factors as the main causes of failures. Technological disasters could no longer be ascribed to isolated equipment malfunction, operator error or acts of God.<ref name=nature477/> </blockquote>\n\n===Comparison to U.S. Navy operations===\nFollowing the [[Three Mile Island]] (TMI) power plant's partial core melt on March 28, 1979, President [[Jimmy Carter]] commissioned a study, ''Report of the President's Commission on the Accident at Three Mile Island'' (1979).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.threemileisland.org/downloads/188.pdf|format=PDF|title=The Accident at Three Mile Island|publisher=Threemileisland.org|accessdate=2014-12-12}}</ref> Subsequently, [[Admiral]] [[Hyman G. Rickover]] was asked to testify before Congress in the general context of answering the question as to why naval nuclear propulsion (as used in [[Nuclear submarine|submarines]]) had succeeded in achieving a record of zero reactor-accidents (as defined by the uncontrolled release of fission products to the environment resulting from damage to a reactor core) as opposed to the dramatic one that had just taken place at Three Mile Island. In his testimony, he said:\n\n<blockquote>Over the years, many people have asked me how I run the [[Naval Reactors]] Program, so that they might find some benefit for their own work. I am always chagrined at the tendency of people to expect that I have a simple, easy gimmick that makes my program function. Any successful program functions as an integrated whole of many factors. Trying to select one aspect as the key one will not work. Each element depends on all the others.<ref>http://www.navy.mil/navydata/testimony/safety/bowman031029.txt</ref></blockquote>\n\n==''The China Syndrome''==\nOn March 16, 1979, twelve days before the accident, the movie ''[[The China Syndrome]]'' premiered, and was initially met with backlash from the nuclear power industry, claiming it to be \"sheer fiction\" and a \"character assassination of an entire industry.\"<ref>[https://www.nytimes.com/1979/03/18/archives/nuclear-experts-debate-the-china-syndrome-but-does-it-satisfy-the.html?_r=0 Nuclear Experts Debate ‘The China Syndrome’ David Burnham ''The New York Times'' 18 March 1979]</ref> In the film, television reporter Kimberly Wells ([[Jane Fonda]]) and her cameraman Richard Adams ([[Michael Douglas]]) secretly filmed a major accident at a nuclear power plant while taping a series on [[nuclear power]].
