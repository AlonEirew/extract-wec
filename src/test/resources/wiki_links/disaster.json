Each of these [[megathrust earthquake]]s also spawned tsunamis in the Pacific Ocean. However, the death toll from these was significantly lower, primarily because of the lower population density along the coasts near affected areas and the much greater distances to more populated coasts and also due to the superior infrastructure and warning systems in MEDCs (More Economically Developed Countries) such as Japan.\n\nOther very large [[megathrust earthquake]]s occurred in 1868 ([[Peru]], [[Nazca Plate]] and [[South American Plate]]); 1827 ([[Colombia]], Nazca Plate and South American Plate); 1812 ([[Venezuela]], [[Caribbean Plate]] and South American Plate) and [[1700 Cascadia earthquake|1700]] (western North America, [[Juan de Fuca Plate]] and [[North American Plate]]).

An estimated {{convert|1600|km|mi|-2}} of [[Fault (geology)|fault surface]] slipped (or ruptured) about {{convert|15|m|ft|-1}} along the [[subduction]] zone where the [[Indian Plate]] slides (or subducts) under the overriding [[Burma Plate]]. The slip did not happen instantaneously but took place in two phases over a period of several minutes:\nSeismographic and acoustic data indicate that the first phase involved a rupture about {{convert|400|km|mi|-1}} long and {{convert|100|km|mi|-1}} wide, located {{convert|30|km|mi}} beneath the sea bed—the largest rupture ever known to have been caused by an earthquake. The rupture proceeded at a speed of about {{convert|2.8|km/s|abbr=off}} ({{convert|10000|km/h|mi/h|disp=or|abbr=on}}), beginning off the coast of [[Aceh]] and proceeding north-westerly over a period of about 100&nbsp;seconds.\nA pause of about another 100&nbsp;seconds took place before the rupture continued northwards towards the [[Andaman Islands|Andaman]] and [[Nicobar Islands]]. However, the northern rupture occurred more slowly than in the south, at about {{convert|2.1|km/s|abbr=on}} ({{convert|7500|km/h|disp=or|abbr=on}}), continuing north for another five minutes to a plate boundary where the fault type changes from subduction to [[Strike-slip fault|strike-slip]] (the two plates slide past one another in opposite directions).\n\nThe [[Indian Plate]] is part of the great [[Indo-Australian Plate]], which underlies the Indian Ocean and [[Bay of Bengal]], and is drifting north-east at an average of 6 centimetres per year ({{convert|6|cm|in|disp=output number only}} inches per year). The India Plate meets the [[Burma Plate]] (which is considered a portion of the great [[Eurasian Plate]]) at the [[Sunda Trench]]. At this point the India Plate subducts beneath the Burma Plate, which carries the [[Nicobar Islands]], the [[Andaman Islands]], and northern [[Sumatra]]. The India Plate sinks deeper and deeper beneath the Burma Plate until the increasing temperature and pressure drive [[volatiles]] out of the subducting plate. These volatiles rise into the overlying plate causing [[partial melting]] and the formation of [[magma]]. The rising magma intrudes into the crust above and exits the [[Earth]]'s crust through [[volcano]]es in the form of a [[volcanic arc]]. The volcanic activity that results as the Indo-Australian Plate subducts the [[Eurasian Plate]] has created the [[Sunda Arc]].\n\nAs well as the sideways movement between the plates, the [[sea floor]] is estimated to have risen by several metres, displacing an estimated {{convert|30|km3|cumi}} of water and triggering devastating [[tsunami]] waves. The waves did not originate from a [[point source]], as was inaccurately depicted in some illustrations of their paths of travel, but rather radiated outwards along the entire {{convert|1600|km|mi|-2|adj=on}} length of the rupture (acting as a [[line source]]). This greatly increased the geographical area over which the waves were observed, reaching as far as Mexico, Chile, and the Arctic. The raising of the sea floor significantly reduced the capacity of the Indian Ocean, producing a permanent rise in the global sea level by an estimated {{convert|0.1|mm|sigfig=1}}.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Bilham|first1=Roger|title=A Flying Start, Then a Slow Slip|journal=[[Science (journal)|Science]]|date=20 May 2005|volume=308|issue=5725|pages=1126–1127|doi=10.1126/science.1113363|bibcode=2005Sci...308.1126B}}</ref>\n\n===Aftershocks and other earthquakes===\n[[File:Neic slav fig72.gif|thumb|250px|Locations of initial earthquake and all aftershocks measuring greater than 4.0 from 26 December 2004 to 10 January 2005.

The seismograms are arranged vertically by distance from the epicenter in degrees. The earliest, lower amplitude, signal is that of the compressional (P) wave, which takes about 22&nbsp;minutes to reach the other side of the planet (the [[Antipodes|antipode]]; in this case near Ecuador). The largest amplitude signals are seismic surface waves that reach the antipode after about 100&nbsp;minutes. The surface waves can be clearly seen to reinforce near the antipode (with the closest seismic stations in Ecuador), and to subsequently encircle the planet to return to the epicentral region after about 200&nbsp;minutes.

Distance alone was no guarantee of safety, as [[Somalia]] was hit harder than Bangladesh despite being much farther away.\n\nBecause of the distances involved, the tsunami took anywhere from fifteen minutes to seven hours to reach the coastlines.<ref>{{cite web|title=Tsunami time travel map |url=http://tsun.sscc.ru/tsulab/20041226trt.htm |publisher=Tsunami Laboratory, Novosibirsk, Russia |accessdate=20 July 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120403182951/http://tsun.sscc.ru/tsulab/20041226trt.htm |archivedate=3 April 2012 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://staff.aist.go.jp/kenji.satake/Sumatra-E.html |title=Time travel map: Active Fault Research Center: National Institute of Advanced Industrial Science and Technology, Japan |publisher=Staff.aist.go.jp |accessdate=24 December 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120717104438/http://staff.aist.go.jp/kenji.satake/Sumatra-E.html |archivedate=17 July 2012 }}</ref> The northern regions of the Indonesian island of Sumatra were hit very quickly, while Sri Lanka and the east coast of India were hit roughly 90&nbsp;minutes to two hours later.

Setting up the communications infrastructure to issue timely warnings is an even bigger problem, particularly in a relatively poor part of the world.\n\nTsunamis are much more frequent in the [[Pacific Ocean]] because of earthquakes in the \"[[Ring of Fire]]\", and an effective tsunami warning system has long been in place there. Although the extreme western edge of the Ring of Fire extends into the Indian Ocean (the point where the earthquake struck), no warning system exists in that ocean. Tsunamis there are relatively rare despite earthquakes being relatively frequent in Indonesia. The last major tsunami was caused by the [[Krakatoa]] eruption of 1883. It should be noted that not every earthquake produces large tsunamis; on 28 March 2005, a magnitude 8.7 earthquake hit roughly the same area of the Indian Ocean but did not result in a major tsunami.\n\nThe first warning sign of a possible tsunami is the earthquake itself. However, tsunamis can strike thousands of kilometres away where the earthquake is only felt weakly or not at all. Also, in the minutes preceding a tsunami strike, the sea often recedes temporarily from the coast, which was observed on the eastern side of the rupture zone of the earthquake such as around the coastlines of [[Aceh]] province, [[Phuket]] island and [[Khao Lak]] area in Thailand, [[Penang]] island of Malaysia and the [[Andaman and Nicobar islands]]. Around the Indian Ocean, this rare sight reportedly induced people, especially children, to visit the coast to investigate and collect stranded fish on as much as 2.5&nbsp;km (1.6&nbsp;mi) of exposed beach, with fatal results.<ref>{{cite web|last=Block|first=Melissa|url=http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=4246573|title=Sri Lankans Seek Lost Relatives After Tsunami|work=[[All Things Considered]]|publisher=[[NPR]]|date=27 December 2004|accessdate=20 December 2016}}</ref> However, not all tsunamis cause this \"disappearing sea\" effect. In some cases, there are no warning signs at all: the sea will suddenly swell without retreating, surprising many people and giving them little time to flee.\n\nReportedly, [[scuba divers]] near the abundant [[coral reefs]] in [[Thailand]] and the [[Maldives]] were caught off guard by violent, swirling underwater [[Current (stream)|currents]].

The first wave came within 5 minutes of the earthquake. The second and third waves came 10 minutes after first and second waves respectively. The second wave was the strongest with a loud noise. Deadly tsunami waves wreaked havoc in this densely populated Jogindar Nagar area, situated 13&nbsp;km south of Campbell Bay. According to local information, tsunami waves attacked the area thrice. The first wave came 5 minutes after the main shock (0629 hrs.) with a marginal drop in sea level. Second wave came 10 minutes after the first one with a maximum height of 4.84&nbsp;m (15.9&nbsp;ft) and caused the major destruction.

Estimates based on the state of the [[shoreline]] and a high-water mark on a nearby building place the tsunami 7.5–9 m (24.6&nbsp;ft to 29.5&nbsp;ft) above sea level and 2–3 m (6.6&nbsp;ft to 9.8&nbsp;ft) higher than the top of the train.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>\n\nIn Sri Lanka, the civilian casualties were second only to those in [[Indonesia]]. Reports vary on the number of deaths since many people are still missing and the country lacks adequate communications. The eastern shores of Sri Lanka faced the hardest impact since they were facing the epicenter of the earthquake. The southwestern shores were hit later, but the death toll was just as severe. The southwestern shores are a hotspot for tourists as well as the fishing economy. Tourism and fishing industries created high population densities along the coast.<ref name=\"ReferenceC\">{{cite web|url=http://academic.evergreen.edu/g/grossmaz/HELGESTJ/|title=Tsunami – Tsunami Disaster in Sri Lanka|publisher=}}</ref>\n\nThe coastal lifestyle of people and degradation of the natural environment in Sri Lanka contributed to the high death tolls. In addition to the high number of fatalities, approximately 90,000 buildings were destroyed. Houses were easily destroyed since they were built mostly from wood.<ref name=\"ReferenceC\"/>\n\n===Thailand===\nThe tsunami hit the southwest coast of southern [[Thailand]], which was about 500&nbsp;km (310.69 miles) from the epicenter. The region is prominent with tourists internationally. Since the tsunami hit during high tide, its damage was severe. Approximately 5,400 people were killed and 3,100 people were reported missing in Thailand. The places where the tsunami struck were Khao Lak, Phuket Island, the [[Phi Phi Islands]], Koh Racha Yai, Koh Lanta Yai and Ao Nang of [[Krabi province]], offshore archipelagos like the [[Surin Islands]], the [[Similan Islands]], and coastal areas of [[Satun]], [[Ranong]], [[Phang Nga]], [[Trang, Thailand|Trang]] and [[Krabi]] provinces.\n\nThe country experienced the largest tsunami runup height of any location outside of [[Sumatra]], which occurred at [[Khao Lak]] and the areas of Takua Pa district that are facing the Andaman Sea. The tsunami heights recorded:<ref name=\"ReferenceB\"/><ref name=\"marine.tmd.go.th\">http://www.marine.tmd.go.th/Presentation/Alexandria/The%202004%20Indian%20tsunami%20in%20Thailand%20Surveyed%20runup%20heights%20and%20tide%20gauge%20records.pdf</ref>\n\n* 6–10 m (19.7&nbsp;ft–32.8&nbsp;ft) in Khao Lak.\n* 3–6 m (9.84&nbsp;ft–19.7&nbsp;ft) along the west coast of Phuket island.\n* 3&nbsp;m (9.84&nbsp;ft) along the south coast of Phuket island.\n* 2&nbsp;m (6.56&nbsp;ft) along the east coast of Phuket island.\n* 4–6 m (13.12&nbsp;ft–19.7&nbsp;ft) on the Phi Phi Islands.\n* 19.6&nbsp;m (64.3&nbsp;ft) at Ban Thung Dap.\n* 5&nbsp;m (16.4&nbsp;ft) at Ramson.\n* 6.8&nbsp;m (22.3&nbsp;ft) at Ban Thale Nok.\n* 5&nbsp;m (16.4&nbsp;ft) at Hat Praphat (Ranong Coastal Resources Research Station).\n* 6.3&nbsp;m (20.7&nbsp;ft) at Thai Muang district.\n* 6.8&nbsp;m (22.3&nbsp;ft) at Rai Dan.\n\nThe province of Phang-Nga was the most heavily affected area in Thailand by the gigantic tsunami. The northern part of Phang-Nga Province is a rural area with fishery and agricultural villages while the central part has several resort hotels. Khao Lak is located in the south of Phang-Nga Province with many luxurious hotels, popular to foreign tourists, especially from [[Europe]]. Khao Lak was hit by the gigantic tsunami after 10:00&nbsp;a.m. and the death toll in the area was the largest in Thailand.<ref>http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.564.5976&rep=rep1&type=pdf</ref> Many local villagers and tourists lost their lives during the event. A maximum inundation of approximately 2&nbsp;km (1.2 miles) and the inundated depths were 4–7 m (13.12&nbsp;ft–23&nbsp;ft) in Khao Lak. Surveys conducted show that the tsunami inundated the third floor of a resort hotel. The tsunami heights in Khao Lak were much higher than Phuket Island. The reason for the difference seems to have been caused by the local [[bathymetry]] off Khao Lak. According to some interviews with local residents and affected tourists, the leading wave produced an initial depression, called a tsunami drawback or 'disappearing sea' effect and the second wave was largest.<ref name=\"ReferenceB\">http://www.tsunami.civil.tohoku.ac.jp/sumatra2004/C4.pdf</ref>\nThe highest recorded tsunami runup measured was at 19.6&nbsp;m (64.3&nbsp;ft) at Ban Thung Dap, located on the southwest tip of [[Ko Phra Thong|Ko Phra Thong Island]] and the second highest at 15.8&nbsp;m (51.8&nbsp;ft) at Ban Nam Kim.<ref name=\"marine.tmd.go.th\"/>\n[[File:Khao Lak Police Boat 813.jpg|thumbnail|Thai navy boat 813 (police boat) stranded almost 2 km inland by the [[Khao Lak]] tsunami.]]\n\nAt Phuket island, many of its west coast beaches were affected. At [[Patong Beach]] – a tourist mecca – the tsunami heights were 5–6 m (16.4&nbsp;ft–19.7&nbsp;ft) and the inundated depth was about 2&nbsp;m (6.6&nbsp;ft). The tsunami heights became lower from the west coast, the south coast to the east coast of the island. On Karon beach on the west coast, the coastal road was built higher than the shore and it acted as a seawall, protecting a hotel which was behind it. On the east coast of Phuket Island, which was not facing the tsunami source, the tsunami height was about 2&nbsp;m (6.6&nbsp;ft). In one river mouth, many boats were damaged. The tsunami propagated anticlockwise around Phuket Island, as was the case at [[Okushiri Island]] in the [[1993 Hokkaido earthquake]]. According to some interviews with the people, the leading wave produced an initial depression and the second wave was the largest.<ref name=\"ReferenceB\"/>\n\n[[File:Tsunami Phuket.jpg|thumbnail|Tsunami wave striking Phuket coast.]]\n\nThe [[Phi Phi Islands]] are a group of small [[islands]] that were affected by the tsunami. The north bay of Phi Phi Don Island opens to the northwest, thus it faced in the direction that the tsunami came from. The measured tsunami height on this [[beach]] was 5.8&nbsp;m (19.02&nbsp;ft). According to some eyewitnesses accounts, the [[tsunami]] came from the north and south, and totally washed the central area away. The ground level here was about 2&nbsp;m (6.6&nbsp;ft) above sea level, but there were many cottages and hotels. Therefore, the tsunami waves from the north and south destroyed the area, the south bay opens to the southeast. It faces in the opposite direction to which the tsunami was propagated. Further, Phi Phi Le Island shields the port of Phi Phi Don Island. The measured tsunami height, however, was 4.6&nbsp;m (15.1&nbsp;ft) in the port. It indicated that the tsunami propagated around the islands.<ref name=\"ReferenceB\"/>\n\nMany amateur videos recorded by tourists and locals of the tsunami at Thailand were televised popularly in the media.\n\n=== Mainland India===\nThe tsunami arrived in the states of [[Andhra Pradesh]] and [[Tamil Nadu]] along the southeast coast of the Indian mainland shortly after 9:00&nbsp;a.m. At least two hours later, it arrived in the state of [[Kerala]] along the southwest coast. Tamil Nadu, the union territory of [[Pondicherry]] and Kerala were extensively damaged, while Andhra Pradesh sustained moderate damage. There were two to five [[water waves|waves]] of varying [[height]] that coincided with the local high tide in some areas.<ref name=\"mapsofindia.com\">{{cite web|url=http://www.mapsofindia.com/maps/tsunami-in-india/tsunami-affected-area-india.html|title=Tsunami Affected Areas in India 2004|publisher=}}</ref><ref>http://academic.evergreen.edu/g/grossmaz/cramerbd/%3E</ref><ref name=\"books.google.com.my\">{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=fICXQSPJwx8C|title=Natural and Anthropogenic Disasters: Vulnerability, Preparedness and Mitigation|first=M.

The inundation distance varied with topology and vegetation. Areas with dense [[coconut]] groves or [[mangroves]] had much smaller inundation distances, and those with [[river]] mouths or backwaters saw much larger inundation distances.{{citation needed|date=June 2016}}Presence of seawalls at the [[Kerala]] coast and some of Tamil Nadu coast helped to reduce the impact of the waves. However, when the seawalls were made of loose stones, the stones were displaced and carried a few metres inland.<ref name=\"mapsofindia.com\"/><ref name=\"books.google.com.my\"/><ref name=\"academic.evergreen.edu\"/>\n\nThe state of [[Kerala]] experienced tsunami-related damage in three southern districts, [[Ernakulam]], [[Alappuzha]], and [[Kollam]], which are densely populated with villagers, due to diffraction of the waves around [[Sri Lanka]]. The southernmost district of [[Thiruvananthpuram]], however, escaped damage, possibly due to the wide turn of the diffracted waves at the peninsular tip. Major damage occurred in two narrow strips of land bound on the west by the [[Arabian Sea]] and on the east by a network of [[Backwater (river)|backwaters]] – [[Kerala backwaters]]. The waves receded before the first tsunami with the highest fatality reported from the densely populated Alappad panchayat (including the villages of Cheriya Azhikkal and Azhikkal) at Kollam district, caused by a 4&nbsp;m (13.1&nbsp;ft) tsunami.<ref name=\"iitk.ac.in\"/>\n\nThe worst affected area in [[Tamil Nadu]] was [[Nagapattinam district]], with a reported 6,051 fatalities caused by a 5&nbsp;m (16.4&nbsp;ft) tsunami, followed by Cuddalore district, with many villages destroyed.<ref name=\"iitk.ac.in\"/> The 13&nbsp;km (8.1 miles) Marina Beach in [[Chennai]] was battered by the tsunami which swept across the beach taking morning walkers unaware. Besides that, a 10&nbsp;m (33&nbsp;ft) black muddy tsunami reportedly ravaged the city of [[Karaikal]], where 492 lives were lost. The city of [[Pondicherry]], protected by seawalls relatively escaped unscathed in comparison to other areas in the state.<ref name=\"iitk.ac.in\"/>\n\nAt the same time, many villages from many districts at the state of [[Andhra Pradesh]] were destroyed. In the Krishna district, the tsunami created havoc in Manginapudi and on Machalipattanam Beach, which came like a running wall at the latter. The most affected was Prakasham District, recording 35 deaths, with maximum damage at Singraikonda, a beautiful beach hamlet.<ref name=\"iitk.ac.in\"/>\n\nGiven the enormous power of the tsunami, the fishing industry suffered the greatest. Moreover, the cost of damage in the transport sector was reported in the tens of thousands.<ref name=\"iitk.ac.in\"/> Many buildings and infrastructures near the coast were obliterated.\n\nConclusively, the tsunami effects varied greatly across different parts of the coast according to the number of waves experienced, the inundation distance and height of waves, and the population density of the area, as well as topological and geographical features that made some areas\nmore vulnerable than others. Besides these factors, the number of lives lost was influenced by exposure to previous disasters and the local disaster management capability. Most of the people killed were members of the fishing community and, in some cases such as [[Marina Beach]] at [[Chennai]] and Velankanni in [[Nagapattinam]], they were visitors on the beach.<ref name=\"iitk.ac.in\"/>\n\n===Maldives===\nThe tsunami of 26 December 2004 severely affected the [[Maldives]] at a distance of 2,500&nbsp;km (1553.4 miles) from the [[epicenter]] of the magnitude 9.0 earthquake. Identically to [[Sri Lanka]], survivors reported three waves with the second wave being the most powerful.<ref name=\"faculty.vassar.edu\"/> Being rich in coral reefs, the [[Maldives]] provides an opportunity for scientists to assess the impact of a tsunami on [[coral]] [[atolls]]. The significantly lower tsunami impact on the Maldives compared to [[Sri Lanka]] is largely due to the topography and [[bathymetry]] of the atoll chain with offshore coral reefs, deep channels separating individual atolls and its arrival within low tide which decreased the power of the tsunami. After the tsunami, there were some concern that the country might be totally submerged and become uninhabitable. However, this was proven untrue.<ref>http://faculty.vassar.edu/brmcadoo/EERI_Maldives_FzSyMcCa3.pdf</ref>\n\nThe largest tsunami wave measured was 4&nbsp;m (13.1&nbsp;ft) at Vilufushi Island (Thaa Atoll). The tsunami arrived approximately 2 hours after the earthquake. The greatest tsunami inundation occurred at North Male Atoll, Male island at 250 m (0.155 miles) along the streets.<ref name=\"faculty.vassar.edu\"/>\n\nThe Maldives tsunami wave analysis:<ref name=\"faculty.vassar.edu\"/>\n\n* 1.3 m-2.4 m (4.27&nbsp;ft–7.87&nbsp;ft) at North Male Atoll, Male Island.\n* 2&nbsp;m (6.56&nbsp;ft) at North Male Atoll, Huhule Island.\n* 1.7 m-2.8 m (5.58&nbsp;ft–9.2&nbsp;ft) at South Male Atoll, Embudhu Finothu.\n* 2.5 m-3.3 m (8.2&nbsp;ft–10.8&nbsp;ft) at Laamu Atoll, Fonadhoo Island.\n* 2.2 m-2.9 m (7.2&nbsp;ft–9.51&nbsp;ft) at Laamu Atoll, Gan Island.\n* 2.3 m-3 m (7.5&nbsp;ft–9.8&nbsp;ft) at North Male Atoll, Dhiffushi Island.\n* 2.2 m-2.4 m (7.2&nbsp;ft–7.87&nbsp;ft) at North Male Atoll, Huraa Island.\n* more than 1.5&nbsp;m (4.92&nbsp;ft) at North Male Atoll, Kuda Huraa Island.\n\n===Myanmar===\nIn [[Myanmar]], the tsunami caused only moderate damage, which arrived between 2 and 5.5 hours after the earthquake. Although the country's western [[Andaman Sea]] coastline lies at the proximity of the rupture zone, there were smaller tsunamis than the neighboring Thai coast, probably because the main tsunami source did not extend to the Andaman Islands. Another factor is that some coasts of [[Taninthayi Division]] was protected by offshore islands of the [[Myeik Archipelago]]. Based on scientific surveys from Ayeyarwaddy Delta through Taninthayi Division, it is revealed that tsunami heights along the Myanmar coast were between 0.4–2.9 m (1.3–9.5&nbsp;ft). Eyewitnesses often compared the December tsunami heights with the “rainy season high tide”; although at most locations, the tsunami height was similar or smaller than the “rainy season high tide” level.<ref name=\"terrapub.co.jp\">https://www.terrapub.co.jp/journals/EPS/pdf/2006/5802/58020243.pdf</ref>\n\nTsunami survey heights:\n\n* 0.6 m-2.3 m (1.97&nbsp;ft–7.54&nbsp;ft) around the Ayeyarwady delta.\n* 0.9 m-2.9 m (2.95&nbsp;ft–9.5&nbsp;ft) at [[Dawei]] area.\n* 0.7 m-2.2 m (2.3&nbsp;ft–7.2&nbsp;ft) around [[Myeik, Burma|Myeik]].\n* 0.4 m-2.6 m (1.3&nbsp;ft–8.5&nbsp;ft) around [[Kawthaung]].\n\nInterviews with local people indicate that they did not feel the earthquake in [[Taninthayi Division]] or in Ayeyarwaddy Delta. The 71 casualties can be attributed to poor housing infrastructure and additionally, the fact that the coastal residents in the surveyed areas live on flat land along the coast, especially in the Ayeyarwaddy Delta, and that there is no higher ground to evacuate. The tsunami heights from the 2004 December earthquake\nwere not more than 3&nbsp;m (9.8&nbsp;ft) along the Myanmar coast, the amplitudes are slightly large off the Ayeyarwaddy Delta, probably because the shallow delta cause a concentration in tsunami energy.<ref name=\"terrapub.co.jp\"/>\n\n===Somalia===\nThe [[tsunami]] spawned from the [[megathrust earthquake]] near [[Sumatra]] travelled 5000&nbsp;km (3106.86 miles) west across the open ocean before striking the East African country of [[Somalia]]. Around 289 fatalities were reported in the [[Horn of Africa]], drowned by four tsunami waves. The hardest hit was a 650&nbsp;km (403.9 miles) stretch of the Somalia coastline between Garacad ([[Mudug]] region) and Xaafuun ([[Bari]] region), which forms part of the [[Puntland]] Province. Most of the victims were reported along the low-lying Xaafuun Peninsula.<ref name=\"2004tsunami.ce.gatech.edu\">http://2004tsunami.ce.gatech.edu/publications/som_eqs_v22-iS3_106607eqs.pdf</ref> The Puntland coast in northern Somalia was by far the area hardest hit by the waves to the west of the Indian subcontinent. The waves arrived around noon local time.<ref name=\"2004tsunami.ce.gatech.edu\"/>\n\nConsequently, tsunami runup heights vary from 5&nbsp;m (16.4&nbsp;ft) to 9&nbsp;m (29.5&nbsp;ft) with inundation distances varying from 44 m (0.027 miles) to 704 m (0.44 miles). The maximum runup height of almost 9&nbsp;m (29.5&nbsp;ft) was recorded in Bandarbeyla.

For example, in the [[United Kingdom]] the public donated roughly £330,000,000 sterling (nearly US$600,000,000). This considerably outweighed the donation by the government and came to an average of about £5.50 (US$10) donated by every citizen.\n\nIn August 2006, fifteen local aid staff working on post-tsunami rebuilding were found executed in northeast Sri Lanka after heavy fighting, the main umbrella body for aid agencies in the country said. There had been reports and rumors that the local aid workers had been killed.\n\n==Impact==\n===Economic impacts===\nThe level of damage to the economy resulting from the tsunami depends on the scale examined. While local economies were devastated, the overall impact to the national economies was minor. The two main occupations affected by the tsunami were fishing and tourism.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Gunatillake|first=Daya|title=The 2004 Tsunami in Sri Lanka: Destruction and recovery|journal=Geography|year=2007|volume=92|issue=3|pages=285–293|jstor=40574342}}</ref> The impact on [[Fisheries#Fisheries and communities|coastal fishing communities]] and the people living there, some of the poorest in the region, has been devastating with high losses of [[income earner]]s as well as boats and fishing gear.<ref>Staff Writer. \"[http://www.ukabc.org/tsunamis.htm Indian Ocean Tsunamis Devastate Fisherfolk].\" UK Agricultural Biodiversity Coalition. 26 December 2004.</ref> In Sri Lanka artisanal fishery, where the use of fish baskets, fishing traps, and spears are commonly used, is an important source of fish for local markets; industrial fishery is the major economic activity, providing direct employment to about 250,000 people. In recent years the fishery industry has emerged as a dynamic export-oriented sector, generating substantial foreign exchange earnings. Preliminary estimates indicate that 66% of the fishing fleet and industrial infrastructure in coastal regions have been destroyed by the wave surges, which will have adverse economic effects both at local and national levels.<ref>Staff Writer. \"Food Supply and Food Security Situation in Countries Affected by the Asia Tsunami.\" Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations. 14 January 2005.</ref>\n\nWhile the tsunami destroyed many of the boats vital to Sri Lanka's fishing industry, it also created demand for fiberglass reinforced plastic [[catamaran]]s in boatyards of [[Tamil Nadu]]. Since over 51,000 vessels were lost to the tsunami, the industry boomed. However, the huge demand has led to lower quality in the process, and some important materials were sacrificed to cut prices for those who were impoverished by the tsunami.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bobpigo.org/bbn/sep_06/pages10-12.pdf |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5tul4D7Pz?url=http://www.bobpigo.org/bbn/sep_06/pages10-12.pdf |archivedate=1 November 2010 |title=Demand for FRP boats rise after tsunami |format=PDF |accessdate=12 August 2010 |deadurl=no |df=dmy }}</ref>\n\nBut some economists believe that damage to the affected national economies will be minor because losses in the tourism and fishing industries are a relatively small percentage of the GDP. However, others caution that damage to infrastructure is an overriding factor. In some areas drinking water supplies and farm fields may have been contaminated for years by salt water from the ocean.<ref>Pearce, Fred. \"[https://www.newscientist.com/article.ns?id=dn6840 Tsunami's salt water may leave islands uninhabitable].\" ''[[New Scientist]].'' 5 January 2005. {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080422084629/http://www.newscientist.com/article.ns?id=dn6840 |date=22 April 2008 }}</ref> Even though only coastal regions were directly affected by the waters of the tsunami, the indirect effects have spread to inland provinces as well. Since the media coverage of the event was so extensive, many tourists cancelled vacations and trips to that part of the world, even though their travel destinations may not have been affected. This ripple effect could especially be felt in the inland provinces of Thailand, such as Krabi, which acted like a starting point for many other tourist destinations in Thailand.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Rigg|first=Johnathan|author2=Lisa Lawt |author3=May Tan-Mullins |author4=Carl Grundy-Warr|title=The Indian Ocean Tsunami: Socio-Economic Impacts in Thailand.|journal=The Geographic Journal|date=December 2005|volume=171|issue=4|pages=374–379|jstor=3451210|doi=10.1111/j.1475-4959.2005.00175_3.x}}</ref>\n\nBoth the earthquake and the tsunami may have affected shipping in the [[Malacca Straits]], which separate Malaysia and the Indonesian island of Sumatra, by changing the depth of the seabed and by disturbing navigational buoys and old shipwrecks. In one area of the Strait, water depths were previously up to {{convert|4,000|ft|m}}, and are now only {{convert|100|ft|m}} in some areas, making shipping impossible and dangerous. These problems also made the delivery of relief aid more challenging. Compiling new navigational charts may take months or years.

However, tourists were reluctant to do so for psychological reasons.

It has been reported that severe damage has been inflicted on [[ecosystem]]s such as [[mangrove]]s, [[coral reef]]s, forests, coastal [[wetland]]s, vegetation, sand [[dune]]s and [[rock (geology)|rock]] formations, animal and plant [[biodiversity]] and [[groundwater]]. In addition, the spread of solid and liquid waste and industrial chemicals, [[water pollution]] and the destruction of [[sewage]] collectors and treatment plants threaten the environment even further, in untold ways. The environmental impact will take a long time and significant resources to assess.<ref>Staff Writer. \"[http://www.oceansatlas.org/id/71687 Impact of Tsunamis on Ecosystems].\" ''UN Atlas of the Oceans''. Retrieved 10 March 2005.</ref>\n\nAccording to specialists, the main effect is being caused by poisoning of the [[freshwater]] supplies and of the soil by [[seawater|saltwater]] infiltration and a deposit of a salt layer over arable land. It has been reported that in the Maldives, 16 to 17 coral reef atolls that were overcome by sea waves are completely without fresh water and could be rendered uninhabitable for decades. Uncountable wells that served communities were invaded by sea, sand, and earth; and [[aquifer]]s were invaded through porous rock. Salted-over soil becomes sterile, and it is difficult and costly to restore for agriculture. It also causes the death of plants and important soil micro-organisms. Thousands of rice, mango, and banana plantations in Sri Lanka were destroyed almost entirely and will take years to recover. On the island's east coast, the tsunami contaminated wells on which many villagers relied for drinking water. The Colombo-based [[International Water Management Institute]] monitored the effects of saltwater and concluded that the wells recovered to pre-tsunami drinking water quality one and a half years after the event.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20120302022712/http://www.iwmi.cgiar.org/Publications/Success_Stories/PDF/2010/Issue%207%20-%20Helping_restore_the_quality_of_drinking_water_after_the_tsunami.pdf Helping restore the quality of drinking water after the tsunami.] [[International Water Management Institute]], 2010.

It consisted of a masonry spillway in river section and earthen \nembankments on both sides. The embankment had a 6.1 m top width, with slopes 1 V : \n3 H and 1 V : 2 H respectively for the upstream and downstream slopes and a clay core \nextending through alluvium to the rocks below. The upstream face had a 61 cm small \ngravel and a 61 cm hand packed riprap. The dam was meant to serve an irrigation \nscheme. Its, storage capacity of 1.1 * 108 m3\n. The dam had a height of 22.56 m above \nthe river bed, a 164.5 m of crest length of overflow section, and a total of 3742 m of \ncrest length for the earth dam.\nThe failure was caused by excessive rain and massive flooding leading to the disintegration of the earthen walls of the four kilometer long Machchu II dam. The [[spillway]] capacity provided for 5663 m³/s. The actual observed flow following the intense rainfall reached 16307 m³/s, thrice what the dam was designed for, resulting in its collapse. Within 20 minutes the floods of {{convert|12|to|30|ft|m|abbr=on}} height inundated the low-lying areas of Morvi industrial town located 5&nbsp;km below the dam. During reconstruction of the dam the capacity of the spillway was increased by 4 times and fixed at about 21,000 m³/s.<ref name=\"Polavaridi\">{{cite web |url=http://profshivajirao.googlepages.com/polavaramdam-1 |title=Polavaram Dam Failure Kills 45 Lakhs Of People |author=Rao, Professor T.

Those who live along the creek saw it turn black over the course of a day.

The company has expended approximately $26,886,000 as of July 31, 2011 on remediation efforts.<ref name=settlement /> A huge concern of the cleanup effort was that it be done correctly. Removing oil can create a multitude of problems if it is not handled properly. Oil forced into the creek beds and soils can destroy the natural habitat that a host of wildlife depends on.<ref name=\"Amy Joi O'Donoghue; Josh Smith\"/> The substance also affects waterfowl’s natural water resilience and can contaminate algae, which is eaten by the animals and fish in the stream.<ref name=\"Amy Joi O'Donoghue; Josh Smith\"/>\nChevron sent in an investigation team from Houston and a special hotline has been set up to field complaints and questions from local residents.<ref name=\"Amy Joi O'Donoghue; Josh Smith\"/>\n\n'''Methods'''\n\nResponse measures included maintaining boom operations and deploying emergency response equipment.<ref name=\"Robinson, Bret\" /> The primary method of cleanup for the creek was to flood and drain the impacted area twice through manipulation of the many dams and reservoirs along its path.<ref name=\"ioscproceedings.org\"/> Workers on foot would flush the channel banks using backpack sprayers and floating pumps following each intentional flooding.
