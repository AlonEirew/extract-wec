He played as a striker, and is most notable for his time spent with [[Newcastle United F.C.|Newcastle United]]. He was the first non-British-registered foreign player to become [[English football first tier top scorers|top scorer in England]].\\n\\n==Background==\\nRobledo was born in [[Iquique]], Chile to a Chilean father and an English mother. He emigrated with his family to [[Brampton Bierlow|Brampton]], Yorkshire in 1932, at the age of five, due to the instability in Chile at the time.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://pratina.tripod.com/id16.html|title=All Time Greats|publisher=tripod.com|accessdate=27 November 2015}}</ref>\\n\\n==Club career==\\nRobledo started his footballing career at [[Huddersfield Town A.F.C.|Huddersfield Town]], playing as a [[part-time]] amateur while he earned his money coal mining, though he never managed to break into the first team. He was able to give up the coal mining when he moved to [[Football League Second Division|Second Division]] [[Barnsley F.C.|Barnsley]] during [[World War II]]. [[Football League First Division|First Division]] club [[Newcastle United F.C.|Newcastle United]] signed him on 27 January 1949, for a fee of £26,500. The fee included his brother [[Ted Robledo|Ted]]; Newcastle were only interested in buying George but he refused to move without his brother.\\n\\nRobledo's league debut for Newcastle came in the 2–0 victory away to [[Charlton Athletic F.C.|Charlton Athletic]] on 5 February, while his first league goal came a month later in the [[Tyne–Wear derby|derby]] match against [[Sunderland A.F.C.|Sunderland]] at [[St James' Park]]. Newcastle came out of the match 2–1 winners, with Robledo's goal separating the sides, helping to quickly make him a fan favourite. The other Newcastle goal scorer was [[Jackie Milburn]], marking the start of one of the great striking partnerships in Newcastle United's history. Robledo went on to score 5 more goals in the last 12 games of the season.\\n\\nThe following season, Robledo scored 11 goals for Newcastle, then netted 14 times in the [[1950-51 in English football|1950–51 season]] and became the first South American to play in the [[1951 FA Cup Final|FA Cup final]], when Newcastle beat Blackpool 2–0 to lift the Cup. Robledo finished as [[Football League Division One|Division One]]'s top scorer in the [[1951-52 in English football|1951–52 season]] with 33 goals, 39 in all competitions (equalling [[Hughie Gallacher]]'s record). Robledo finished the season by scoring the goal which defeated [[Arsenal F.C.|Arsenal]] in the [[1952 FA Cup Final|FA Cup final]], helping Newcastle lift the cup in successive seasons. The goal scored by Robledo was drawn by a young [[John Lennon]], who included it in the artwork of his album ''[[Walls and Bridges]]'' in 1974.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Molina|first1=Paula|title=Jorge Robledo, el futbolista chileno inmortalizado en un disco de John Lennon|url=http://www.bbc.com/mundo/noticias/2016/04/160404_deportes_futbol_chile_jorge_robledo_beatles_john_lennon_dibujo_jmp|accessdate=25 April 2017|work=BBC Mundo|date=4 April 2016|language=Spanish}}</ref>{{external media | float = right | width = 300px | video1 = [https://www.britishpathe.com/video/the-cup-final-16 Robledo goal in the 1952 cup final.

At the end of the season, Ted Robledo was sold to [[Colo-Colo]] and George soon followed him, with Colo-Colo paying Newcastle £25,000 for his services. Both brothers were highly popular in Chile, and George ended as top scorer in the Chilean league in 1953 and 1954, with 26 and 25 goals respectively.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rsssf.com/tablesc/chiletops.html|title=Chile - list of Topscorers|publisher=RSSSF.com|accessdate=27 November 2015}}</ref>\\n\\nRobledo left Colo-Colo in 1958, and spent a year out of football, before signing for [[O'Higgins F.C.|Club Deportivo O'Higgins]] where he played out the final years of his career, until his retirement in 1960.\\n\\n==International career==\\n[[Chile national football team|Chile]] recruited Robledo for the [[1950 FIFA World Cup]], even though he spoke no Spanish. He made his debut in the opening group game against [[England national football team|England]] (one of his opponents reputedly warned him after he'd hit the post \\\"Steady, George, you're not playing for Newcastle now, you know\\\")<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.englandfootballonline.com/Seas1946-60/1949-50/M0256Chi1950.html|title=England Match No. 256 - Chile - 25 June 1950 - Match Summary and Report|publisher=England Football Online|accessdate=27 November 2015}}</ref> and scored in Chile's 5–2 victory over the [[United States men's national soccer team|United States]]. He was in the Chile squad for the [[1955 South American Championship|1955]] and [[1957 South American Championship]]s, finishing as runners-up in the former tournament.\\n\\nHe made thirty-one appearances for his national side, scoring eight goals over a period of seven years.\\n\\n==Honours==\\n\\n===Club===\\n;[[Newcastle United F.C.|Newcastle United]]\\n*[[FA Cup]]: [[1951 FA Cup Final|1950–51]], [[1952 FA Cup Final|1951–52]]\\n\\n;[[Colo-Colo]]\\n*[[Campeonato Nacional (Chile)|Primera División de Chile]]: 1953, 1956\\n*[[Copa Chile]]: 1958\\n\\n====Individual awards====\\n*[[Football League First Division|First Division]] top scorer: 1951–52\\n*[[Campeonato Nacional (Chile)|Primera División de Chile]] top scorer: 1953, 1954\\n\\n==Personal life==\\nRobledo married in 1959, and later had a daughter. He finally retired from football in 1961 and took charge of the sports program in St Peter's school, [[Viña del Mar]], where he remained leading a quiet life until his death of a heart attack in April 1989, just before he would have turned 63. He was survived by his wife Gladys and daughter Elizabeth; Gladys, now in her eighties, is still living more than 20 years later.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thenorthernecho.co.uk/news/4826466.Lennon____sketch_of_United_cup_hero___/|title=Newcastle United legend George Robledo on Lennon sketch|publisher=The Northern Echo|date=31 December 2009|accessdate=27 November 2015}}</ref>\\n\\nHis brother Ted had died nearly 20 years earlier, having fallen from an oil tanker into the sea off [[Dubai]] in December 1970, aged only 42.
