The focus on preserving the empire would have negative consequences for Spain's national pride in the aftermath of the Spanish–American War.\n\n===American interest in the Caribbean===\nIn 1823, American fifth President [[James Monroe]] (1758–1831, served 1817–1825) enunciated the [[Monroe Doctrine]], which stated that the [[United States]] would not tolerate further efforts by [[Europe]]an governments to retake, expand their colonial holdings in the [[Americas]] or to interfere with the newly independent states in the hemisphere; at the same time, the doctrine stated that the U.S. would respect the status of the existing European colonies. Before the [[American Civil War]] (1861–1865), Southern interests attempted to have the United States purchase [[Cuba]] and convert it into a new slave territory. The [[Ostend Manifesto]] proposal of 1854 failed, and national attention shifted to the growing sectional conflict and threat of civil war.\n\nAfter the American Civil War and Cuba's [[Ten Years' War]], U.S. businessmen began monopolizing the devalued sugar markets in Cuba. In 1894, 90% of Cuba's total exports went to the United States, which also provided 40% of Cuba's imports.<ref>Pérez, Louis A., Jr, ''Cuba: Between Reform and Revolution''. Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1995. p.&nbsp;149</ref> Cuba's total exports to the U.S. were almost twelve times larger than the export to her mother country, [[Spain]].<ref>Pérez, Louis A., Jr, Cuba: Between Reform and Revolution. Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1995. p.&nbsp;138</ref> U.S. business interests indicated that while Spain still held political authority over Cuba, economic authority in Cuba, acting-authority, was shifting to the US.\n\nThe US became interested in a trans-isthmus canal across [[Central America]], either in [[Nicaragua]], or in [[Panama]], where the [[Panama Canal]] would later be built (1903–1914), and realized the need for naval protection. Captain [[Alfred Thayer Mahan]] was an especially influential theorist; his ideas were much admired by future 26th President [[Theodore Roosevelt]], as the U.S. rapidly built a powerful [[United States Navy|naval fleet]] of steel warships in the 1880s and 1890s. Roosevelt served as [[Assistant Secretary of the Navy]] in 1897–1898 and was an aggressive supporter of an American war with [[Spain]] over Cuban interests.\n\nMeanwhile, the \"Cuba Libre\" movement, led by Cuban intellectual  [[José Martí]], had established offices in [[Florida]]<ref>Gary R. Mormino, \"Cuba Libre, Florida, and the Spanish American War\", ''Theodore Roosevelt Association Journal'' (2010) Vol. 31 Issue 1/2, pp. 43–54</ref> and [[New York (state)|New York]] to buy and smuggle weapons. It mounted a large propaganda campaign to generate sympathy that would lead to official pressure on Spain. [[Protestantism|Protestant]] churches and [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]] farmers were supportive, but business interests called on [[Washington, D.C.|Washington]] to ignore them.<ref>G.

Neither the fighting nor the reforms in the [[Pact of Zanjón]] (February 1878) quelled the desire of some revolutionaries for wider autonomy and ultimately independence. One such revolutionary, [[José Martí]], continued to promote Cuban financial and political autonomy in exile. In early 1895, after years of organizing, Martí launched a three-pronged invasion of the island.<ref name=\"books.google.com\">{{Harvnb|Trask|1996|pp=[https://books.google.com/books?id=2f0Gf0DQfmUC&pg=PA2 2–3]}}</ref>\n\nThe plan called for one group from [[Santo Domingo]] led by [[Máximo Gómez]], one group from [[Costa Rica]] led by [[Antonio Maceo Grajales]], and another from the United States (preemptively thwarted by U.S. officials in Florida) to land in different places on the island and provoke an uprising. While their call for revolution, the ''grito de Baíre'', was successful, the result was not the grand show of force Martí had expected. With a quick victory effectively lost, the revolutionaries settled in to fight a protracted guerrilla campaign.<ref name=\"books.google.com\"/>\n\nAntonio Cánovas del Castillo, the architect of Spain's Restoration constitution and the prime minister at the time, ordered General [[Arsenio Martínez-Campos y Antón|Arsenio Martínez-Campos]], a distinguished veteran of the war against the previous uprising in Cuba, to quell the revolt. Campos's reluctance to accept his new assignment and his method of containing the revolt to the province of [[Oriente Province|Oriente]] earned him criticism in the Spanish press.<ref name=\"online\">Jonathan Krohn, \"Review of Tone, John Lawrence, ''War and Genocide in Cuba 1895–1898''. \"H-War, H-Net Reviews.\" May 2008.

Both papers denounced Spain, but had little influence outside New York. American opinion generally saw Spain as a hopelessly backward power that was unable to deal fairly with Cuba.  American Catholics were divided before the war began, but supported it enthusiastically once it started.<ref>Scott Wright, \"The Northwestern Chronicle and the Spanish–American War: American Catholic Attitudes Regarding the 'Splendid Little War,'\" ''American Catholic Studies'' 116#4 (2005): 55–68.</ref><ref>However, three Catholic newspapers were critical of the war after it began.

How stability would be achieved would depend largely on the ability of Spain and the U.S. to work out their issues diplomatically.\n\nWhile tension increased among the Cubans and Spanish Government, popular support of intervention began to spring up in the United States, due to the emergence of the \"Cuba Libre\" movement and the fact that many Americans had drawn parallels between the American Revolution and the Cuban revolt, seeing the Spanish Government as the tyrannical colonial oppressor. Historian Louis Pérez notes that \"The proposition of war in behalf of Cuban independence took hold immediately and held on thereafter. Such was the sense of the public mood.\" At the time many poems and songs were written in the United States to express support of the \"Cuba Libre\" movement.<ref>{{cite book|author=Louis A.

In accordance with this policy, McKinley began to negotiate with the Spanish government, hoping that the negotiations would be able to end the yellow journalism in the United States, and therefore, end the loudest calls to go to war with Spain. An attempt was made to negotiate a peace before McKinley took office, however, the Spanish refused to take part in the negotiations. In 1897 McKinley appointed [[Stewart L. Woodford]] as the new minister to Spain, who again offered to negotiate a peace. In October 1897, the Spanish government still refused the United States offer to negotiate between the Spanish and the Cubans, but promised the U.S. it would give the Cubans more autonomy.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite book|title=Politics, reform, and expansion, 1890–1900.|last=Faulkner|first=Harold|publisher=Harper|year=1963|isbn=|location=New York|pages=231}}</ref> However, with the election of a more liberal Spanish government in November, Spain began to change their policies in Cuba. First, the new Spanish government told the United States that it was willing to offer a change in the Reconcentration policies (the main set of policies that was feeding yellow journalism in the United States) if the Cuban rebels agreed to a cessation of hostilities. This time the rebels refused the terms in hopes that continued conflict would lead to U.S. intervention and the creation of an independent Cuba.<ref name=\":0\" /> The liberal Spanish government also recalled the Spanish Governor General Valeriano Weyler from Cuba.

Naval forces were moved in position to attack simultaneously on several fronts if the war was not avoided.

McKinley asked Congress to appropriate $50 million for defense, and Congress unanimously obliged. Most American leaders took the position that the cause of the explosion was unknown, but public attention was now riveted on the situation and Spain could not find a diplomatic solution to avoid war.

Other investigations in later years came to various contradictory conclusions, but had no bearing on the coming of the war. In 1974, Admiral [[Hyman George Rickover]] had his staff look at the documents and decided there was an internal explosion. A study commissioned by ''[[National Geographic (magazine)|National Geographic]]'' magazine in 1999, using AME computer modelling, stated that the explosion could have been caused by a mine, but no definitive evidence was found.<ref>For a summary of all the studies see [http://loc.gov/law/help/usconlaw/pdf/Maine.1898.pdf Louis Fisher, \"Destruction of the Maine (1898)\" (2009)]</ref>\n\n===Declaring war===\n{{Main|Propaganda of the Spanish–American War}}\n[[File:Charles A Wikoff.jpg|upright|thumb|250px|United States Army Colonel [[Charles A.

After years of severe depression, the economic outlook for the domestic economy was suddenly bright again in 1897. However, the uncertainties of warfare posed a serious threat to full economic recovery. \"War would impede the march of prosperity and put the country back many years,\" warned the ''New Jersey Trade Review.''  The leading railroad magazine  editorialized, \"From a commercial and mercenary standpoint it seems peculiarly bitter that this war should come when the country had already suffered so much and so needed rest and peace.\"  McKinley paid close attention to the strong anti-war consensus of the business community, and strengthened his resolve to use diplomacy and negotiation rather than brute force to end the Spanish tyranny in Cuba.<ref>{{harvnb|Pratt|1934|pp=163–201}}. quotes on page 168.

While [[Assistant Secretary of the Navy]], he placed the Navy on a war-time footing and prepared Dewey's Asiatic Squadron for battle. He also worked with [[Leonard Wood]] in convincing the Army to raise an all-volunteer regiment, the 1st U.S. Volunteer Cavalry. Wood was given command of the regiment that quickly became known as the \"[[Rough Riders]]\".<ref>{{Harvnb|Roosevelt|1899}}</ref>\n\nThe Americans planned to capture the city of Santiago de Cuba to destroy Linares' army and Cervera's fleet. To reach Santiago they had to pass through concentrated Spanish defenses in the San Juan Hills and a small town in [[El Caney]]. The American forces were aided in Cuba by the pro-independence rebels led by General [[Calixto García]].\n\n====Cuban sentiment====\nFor quite some time the Cuban public believed the United States government to possibly hold the key to its independence, and even annexation was considered for a time, which historian Louis Pérez explored in his book ''Cuba and the United States: Ties of Singular Intimacy''. The Cubans harbored a great deal of discontent towards the Spanish Government, due to years of manipulation on the part of the Spanish. The prospect of getting the United States involved in the fight was considered by many Cubans as a step in the right direction. While the Cubans were wary of the United States' intentions, the overwhelming support from the American public provided the Cubans with some peace of mind, because they believed that the United States was committed to helping them achieve their independence. However, with the imposition of the [[Platt Amendment]] of 1903 after the war, as well as economic and military manipulation on the part of the United States, Cuban sentiment towards the United States became polarized, with many Cubans disappointed with continuing American interference.<ref>{{cite book|author=Mary Beth Norton|title=A People and a Nation, Volume II: Since 1865|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=F0jAAgAAQBAJ&pg=PA582|page=582|year=2014|publisher=Cengage Learning|display-authors=etal}}</ref>\n\n====Land campaign====\nFrom June 22 to 24, the [[Fifth Army Corps (Spanish-American War)|Fifth Army Corps]] under General [[William Rufus Shafter|William R. Shafter]] landed at [[Daiquirí]] and [[Siboney, Cuba|Siboney]], east of Santiago, and established an American base of operations. A contingent of Spanish troops, having fought a skirmish with the Americans near Siboney on June 23, had retired to their lightly entrenched positions at [[Battle of Las Guasimas|Las Guasimas]]. An advance guard of U.S. forces under former [[Confederate States Army|Confederate]] General [[Joseph Wheeler]] ignored Cuban scouting parties and orders to proceed with caution. They caught up with and engaged the Spanish rearguard of about 2,000 soldiers led by General [[Antero Rubín]]<ref>[http://spanishamericanwar.info/cuba.htm#LasGuasimas The Spanish–American War in Cuba : Battle of Las Guasimas].</ref> who effectively ambushed them, in the Battle of Las Guasimas on June 24. The battle ended indecisively in favor of Spain and the Spanish left Las Guasimas on their planned retreat to Santiago.\n\nThe U.S. Army employed [[American Civil War|Civil War]]-era [[Skirmisher#American Civil War|skirmishers]] at the head of the advancing columns. Three of four of the U.S. soldiers who had volunteered to act as skirmishers walking point at the head of the American column were killed, including [[Hamilton Fish II (Rough Rider)|Hamilton Fish II]] (grandson of [[Hamilton Fish]], the Secretary of State under Ulysses S. Grant), and Captain [[Allyn K. Capron, Jr.]], whom Theodore Roosevelt would describe as one of the finest natural leaders and soldiers he ever met. Only [[Oklahoma Territory]] [[Pawnee people|Pawnee]] Indian, Tom Isbell, wounded seven times, survived.<ref name=\"Roosevelt, Theodore p. 572\">Roosevelt, Theodore, ''The Rough Riders'', Scribner's Magazine, Vol. 25 (January–June), New York: Charles Scribner's Sons, p. 572</ref>\n\nThe Battle of Las Guasimas showed the U.S. that quick-thinking American soldiers would not stick to the linear tactics which did not work effectively against Spanish troops who had learned the art of [[Cover (military)|cover and concealment]] from their own struggle with Cuban insurgents, and never made the error of revealing their positions while on the defense. Americans advanced by rushes and stayed in the weeds so that they, too, were largely invisible to the Spaniards who used un-targeted volley fire to try to mass fires against the advancing Americans. While some troops were hit, this technique was mostly a waste of bullets as the Americans learned to duck as soon as they heard the Spanish word Fire, \"Fuego\" yelled by the Spanish officers. Spanish troops were equipped with smokeless powder arms that also helped them to hide their positions while firing.\n\n[[File:Surrender of Santiago news HD-SN-99-01963.JPEG|thumb|250px|Receiving the news of the surrender of Santiago]]\n\nRegular Spanish troops were mostly armed with modern charger-loaded, 7&nbsp;mm [[Mauser Model 1893|1893 Spanish Mauser rifles]] and using [[smokeless powder]]. The high-speed [[7×57mm Mauser]] round was termed the \"Spanish Hornet\" by the Americans because of the supersonic crack as it passed overhead. Other irregular troops were armed with [[Remington Rolling Block]] rifles in [[Service rifle|.43 Spanish]] using smokeless powder and brass-jacketed bullets. US regular infantry were armed with the  [[.30-40 Krag|.30–40]] [[Krag–Jørgensen]], a bolt-action rifle with a complex rotating magazine. Both the US regular cavalry and the volunteer cavalry used smokeless ammunition. In later battles, state volunteers used the [[Springfield Model 1873|.45–70 Springfield]] a single-shot black powder rifle.<ref name=\"Roosevelt, Theodore p. 572\"/>\n\nOn July 1, a combined force of about 15,000 American troops in regular infantry and cavalry regiments, including all four of the army's \"Colored\" regiments, and volunteer regiments, among them Roosevelt and his \"[[Rough Riders]]\", the [[71st Infantry Regiment (New York)|71st New York]], the 2nd Massachusetts Infantry, and 1st North Carolina, and rebel Cuban forces attacked 1,270 entrenched Spaniards in dangerous Civil War-style frontal assaults at the [[Battle of El Caney]] and [[Battle of San Juan Hill]] outside of Santiago.<ref>[http://www.homeofheroes.com/wallofhonor/spanish_am/10_sanjuan.html The Battles at El Caney and San Juan Hills] at HomeOfHeroes.com.</ref> More than 200 U.S. soldiers were killed and close to 1,200 wounded in the fighting, thanks to the high rate of fire the Spanish put down range at the Americans.<ref>[http://www.homeofheroes.com/wallofhonor/spanish_am/11_crowdedhour.html The Crowded Hour: The Charge at El Caney & San Juan Hills] at HomeOfHeroes.com.</ref> Supporting fire by [[Gatling gun]]s was critical to the success of the assault.<ref>{{Harvnb|Parker|2003}}</ref><ref>[http://www.gutenberg.org/etext/6888 ''History of the Gatling Gun Detachment''], John Henry Parker at [[Project Gutenberg]].</ref> Cervera decided to escape Santiago two days later. First Lieutenant [[John J. Pershing]], nicknamed \"Black Jack\", oversaw the 10th Cavalry Unit during the war. Pershing and his unit fought in the [[Battle of San Juan Hill]]. Pershing was cited for his gallantry during the battle.\n\nThe Spanish forces at [[Guantánamo]] were so isolated by Marines and Cuban forces that they did not know that Santiago was under siege, and their forces in the northern part of the province could not break through Cuban lines. This was not true of the Escario relief column from Manzanillo,<ref>[http://www.spanamwar.com/escario.htm Escario's Column], Francisco Jose Diaz Diaz.</ref> which fought its way past determined Cuban resistance but arrived too late to participate in the siege.\n\nAfter the battles of San Juan Hill and El Caney, the American advance halted. Spanish troops successfully defended Fort Canosa, allowing them to stabilize their line and bar the entry to Santiago. The Americans and Cubans forcibly began a bloody, strangling siege of the city.<ref>{{Harvnb|Daley|2000|pp=161–71}}</ref> During the nights, Cuban troops dug successive series of \"trenches\" (raised parapets), toward the Spanish positions. Once completed, these parapets were occupied by U.S. soldiers and a new set of excavations went forward. American troops, while suffering daily losses from Spanish fire, suffered far more casualties from [[Hyperthermia|heat exhaustion]] and [[mosquito]]-borne disease.<ref>{{Harvnb|McCook|1899}}</ref> At the western approaches to the city, Cuban general Calixto Garcia began to encroach on the city, causing much panic and fear of reprisals among the Spanish forces.\n\n====Naval operations====\n{{unreferenced section|date=April 2017}}\n[[File:Santiago campaign 1898.gif|thumb|450px|The Santiago Campaign (1898)]]\n[[File:US Navy Battleship USS Iowa BB-4 Crewmen Pose 1898.jpg|thumb|Crewmen pose under the gun turrets of ''[[USS Iowa (BB-4)|Iowa]]'' in 1898]]\nThe major port of [[Santiago de Cuba]] was the main target of naval operations during the war. The U.S. fleet attacking Santiago needed shelter from the summer [[List of Atlantic hurricane seasons|hurricane season]]; [[Guantánamo Bay]], with its excellent harbor, was chosen. The [[Battle of Guantánamo Bay|1898 invasion of Guantánamo Bay]] happened between June 6 and 10, with the [[battle of Guantánamo Bay#First U.S. attack|first U.S. naval attack]] and subsequent successful landing of [[United States Marine Corps|U.S. Marines]] with naval support.\n\nOn April 23, a council of senior admirals of the [[Spanish Navy]] had decided to order Admiral [[Pascual Cervera y Topete]]'s squadron of four armored cruisers and three torpedo boat destroyers to proceed from their present location in [[Cape Verde]] (having left from [[Cadiz, Spain]]) to the West Indies.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=a3oDAAAAYAAJ&pg=RA3-PA64&lpg=RA3-PA64&dq=Fernando+Mart%C3%ADnez+de+admiral&source=bl&ots=xKrD0TCkuA&sig=NhdM206irX3yMWwWe-ipkVJRr0A&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjKrYOJmLPYAhVD3GMKHYN4CzIQ6AEIOzAI#v=onepage&q=Fernando%20Mart%C3%ADnez%20de%20admiral&f=false Information from abroad: War notes, Issues 1-8] (1899), [[Office of Naval Intelligence]], pp. 60–64</ref>\n\nThe [[Battle of Santiago de Cuba]] on July 3, was the largest naval engagement of the Spanish–American War and resulted in the destruction of the Spanish Caribbean Squadron (also known as the ''Flota de Ultramar''). In May, the fleet of Spanish Admiral Pascual Cervera y Topete had been spotted by American forces in Santiago harbor, where they had taken shelter for protection from sea attack. A two-month stand-off between Spanish and American naval forces followed.\n\nWhen the Spanish squadron finally attempted to leave the harbor on July 3, the American forces destroyed or grounded five of the six ships. Only one Spanish vessel, the new armored cruiser {{Ship|Spanish cruiser|Cristóbal Colón||2}}, survived, but her captain hauled down her flag and [[scuttling|scuttled]] her when the Americans finally caught up with her. The 1,612 Spanish sailors who were captured, including Admiral Cervera, were sent to [[Seavey's Island]] at the [[Portsmouth Naval Shipyard]] in [[Kittery, Maine]], where they were confined at [[Portsmouth Naval Prison|Camp Long]] as [[Prisoner of war|prisoners of war]] from July 11 until mid-September.\n\nDuring the stand-off, U.S. Assistant Naval Constructor, Lieutenant [[Richmond Pearson Hobson]] had been ordered by Rear Admiral [[William T. Sampson]] to sink the [[Collier (ship type)|collier]] {{USS|Merrimac|1894|6}} in the harbor to bottle up the Spanish fleet. The mission was a failure, and Hobson and his crew were captured. They were exchanged on July 6, and Hobson became a national hero; he received the [[Medal of Honor]] in 1933, retired as a Rear Admiral and became a Congressman.\n\n====U.S. withdrawal====\n[[Yellow fever]] had quickly spread amongst the American occupation force, crippling it. A group of concerned officers of the American army chose Theodore Roosevelt to draft [[Round-Robin Letter (Spanish–American War)|a request]] to Washington that it withdraw the Army, a request that paralleled a similar one from General Shafter, who described his force as an \"army of convalescents\". By the time of his letter, 75% of the force in Cuba was unfit for service.<ref name=\"Vincent J. Cirillo 2004\">Vincent J. Cirillo. 2004. ''Bullets and Bacilli: The Spanish–American War and Military Medicine''. (Rutgers University Press).</ref>\n\nOn August 7, the American invasion force started to leave Cuba. The evacuation was not total. The U.S. Army kept the black Ninth US Cavalry Regiment in Cuba to support the occupation. The logic was that their race and the fact that many black volunteers came from southern states would protect them from disease; this logic led to these soldiers being nicknamed \"Immunes\". Still, when the Ninth left, 73 of its 984 soldiers had contracted the disease.<ref name=\"Vincent J. Cirillo 2004\"/>\n\n===Puerto Rico===\n{{main article|Puerto Rican Campaign}}\n[[File:Spanish troops leaving Mayagues, Porto Rico, to engage the American forces at Hormiguero, Puerto Rico, 08-10-1898 - NARA - 533437.tif|thumb|Spanish troops before they departed to engage the American forces at [[Hormigueros, Puerto Rico|Hormigueros]], Porto Rico]]\nIn May 1898, Lt. Henry H. Whitney of the United States Fourth Artillery was sent to Puerto Rico on a reconnaissance mission, sponsored by the Army's Bureau of Military Intelligence. He provided maps and information on the Spanish military forces to the U.S. government before the invasion.\n\nThe American offensive began on May 12, 1898, when a squadron of 12 U.S. ships commanded by Rear Adm. [[William T. Sampson]] of the [[United States Navy]] attacked the [[archipelago]]'s capital, [[San Juan, Puerto Rico|San Juan]]. Though the damage inflicted on the city was minimal, the Americans established a [[blockade]] in the city's harbor, [[San Juan Bay]]. On June 22, the [[cruiser]] [[Spanish cruiser Isabel II|''Isabel II'']] and the [[destroyer]] [[Spanish destroyer Terror|''Terror'']] delivered a [[Second Battle of San Juan|Spanish counterattack]], but were unable to break the blockade and the ''Terror'' was damaged.\n\nThe land offensive began on July 25, when 1,300 infantry soldiers led by [[Nelson A. Miles]] disembarked off the coast of [[Guánica, Puerto Rico|Guánica]]. The first organized armed opposition occurred in [[Yauco]] in what became known as the [[Battle of Yauco]].<ref name=\"AAMPR\">[http://www.spanamwar.com/puertoland2.htm The American Army Moves on Puerto-Rico], Retrieved August 2, 2008</ref>\n\nThis encounter was followed by the [[Battle of Fajardo]]. The United States seized control of [[Fajardo]] on August 1, but were forced to withdraw on August 5 after a group of 200 Puerto Rican-Spanish soldiers led by Pedro del Pino gained control of the city, while most civilian inhabitants fled to a nearby lighthouse. The Americans encountered larger opposition during the [[Battle of Guayama]] and as they advanced towards the main island's interior. They engaged in crossfire at [[Battle of the Guamani River Bridge|Guamaní River Bridge]], [[Battle of Coamo|Coamo]] and [[Battle of Silva Heights|Silva Heights]] and finally at the [[Battle of Asomante]].<ref name=\"AAMPR\"/><ref name=\"Asomante\">{{citation| title=De Coamo a la Trinchera del Asomante| author=Edgardo Pratts| publisher=Fundación Educativa Idelfonso Pratts| location=Puerto Rico| language=Spanish|edition=First| year=2006| isbn=0-9762185-6-9}}</ref> The battles were inconclusive as the allied soldiers retreated.\n\nA battle in [[San Germán, Puerto Rico|San Germán]] concluded in a similar fashion with the Spanish retreating to [[Lares, Puerto Rico|Lares]]. On August 9, 1898, American troops that were pursuing units retreating from Coamo encountered heavy resistance in [[Aibonito, Puerto Rico|Aibonito]] in a mountain known as ''Cerro Gervasio del Asomante'' and retreated after six of their soldiers were injured. They returned three days later, reinforced with artillery units and attempted a surprise attack. In the subsequent crossfire, confused soldiers reported seeing Spanish reinforcements nearby and five American officers were gravely injured, which prompted a retreat order. All military actions in Puerto Rico were suspended on August 13, after U.S. President [[William McKinley]] and French Ambassador [[Jules Cambon]], acting on behalf of the Spanish Government, signed an [[armistice]] whereby Spain relinquished its sovereignty over Puerto Rico.<ref name=\"Asomante\"/>\n\n==Making peace==\n[[File:Jules Cambon signs Treaty of Paris, 1899.JPG|thumb|250px|[[Jules Cambon]], the French Ambassador in the U.S., signing the memorandum of ratification on behalf of Spain]]\nWith defeats in Cuba and the Philippines, and both of its fleets destroyed, Spain [[Suing for peace|sued for peace]] and negotiations were opened between the two parties.

Having been occupied since July 17, 1898, and thus under the jurisdiction of the United States Military Government (USMG), Cuba formed its own civil government and gained independence on May 20, 1902, with the announced end of USMG jurisdiction over the island. However, the U.S. imposed various restrictions on the new government, including prohibiting alliances with other countries, and reserved the right to intervene. The U.S. also established a perpetual lease of [[Guantanamo Bay Naval Base|Guantánamo Bay]].\n\n==Aftermath==\n[[File:TR On Horseback Back From Cuba 1898.jpg|thumb|200px|With the end of the war, Colonel [[Theodore Roosevelt]] musters out of the U.S. Army after the required 30-day quarantine period at [[Montauk, New York|Montauk, Long Island]], in 1898.]]\n\nThe war lasted ten weeks.<ref>{{Citation|last=Brands Breen Williams Gross|title=American Stories \"A History of the United States\"|publisher=Pearson|isbn=9780205243617|pages=536}}</ref> [[John Hay]] (the [[United States Ambassador to the United Kingdom]]), writing from London to his friend [[Theodore Roosevelt]], declared that it had been \"a splendid little war\".<ref>{{citation|url=http://harvardmagazine.com/1998/11/war.html|title=\"A Splendid Little War\"; Harvard and the commencement of a new world order|first=John|last=Bethell|publisher=Harvard magazine|date=November–December 1998|accessdate=December 11, 2007}}</ref><ref>{{Harvnb|Millis|1979|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=e_QlhpIsrXgC&pg=PA340 340]}} <br />\nThis source provides a more complete quote:<blockquote>It has been a splendid little war; begun with the highest motives, carried on with magnificent intelligence and spirit, favored by the fortune which loves the brave.

These officers included [[Matthew Butler]], [[Fitzhugh Lee]], [[Thomas L. Rosser]] and [[Joseph Wheeler]], though only the latter had seen action.

Since then, the U.S. has had a significant hand in various conflicts around the world, and entered many treaties and agreements. The [[Panic of 1893]] was over by this point, and the U.S. entered a [[American Century|long and prosperous period]] of economic and population growth, and technological innovation that lasted through the 1920s.<ref>{{Harvnb|Bailey|1961|p=657}}</ref>\n\nThe war redefined national identity, served as a solution of sorts to the social divisions plaguing the American mind, and provided a model for all future news reporting.<ref>Kaplan, Richard L. 2003. \"American Journalism Goes to War, 1898–2001: a manifesto on media and empire\", p. 211</ref>\n\nThe idea of [[American imperialism]] changed in the public's mind after the short and successful Spanish–American War. Due to the United States' powerful influence diplomatically and militarily, [[Cuba]]'s status after the war relied heavily upon American actions. Two major developments emerged from the Spanish–American War: one, it greatly enforced the United States' vision of itself as a \"defender of democracy\" and as a major world power, and two, it had severe implications for [[Cuban–American relations]] in the future. As historian Louis Pérez argued in his book ''Cuba in the American Imagination: Metaphor and the Imperial Ethos'', the Spanish–American War of 1898 \"fixed permanently how Americans came to think of themselves: a righteous people given to the service of righteous purpose\".<ref>{{harvnb|Pérez|2008|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=9uSsePHCVWAC&pg=PA11 11]}}.</ref>\n\nThe war greatly reduced the [[Spanish Empire]]. Spain had been declining as an imperial power since the early 19th century as a result of [[Peninsular War|Napoleon's invasion]]. The loss of Cuba caused a [[national trauma]] because of the affinity of peninsular Spaniards with Cuba, which was seen as another province of Spain rather than as a colony. Spain retained only a handful of overseas holdings: [[Spanish West Africa]] ([[Spanish Sahara]]), [[Spanish Guinea]], [[Spanish Morocco]], and the [[Canary Islands]].\n\nThe Spanish soldier [[Julio Cervera Baviera]], who served in the [[Puerto Rican Campaign]], published a pamphlet in which he blamed the natives of that colony for its occupation by the Americans, saying, \"I have never seen such a servile, ungrateful country [i.e., Puerto Rico].... In twenty-four hours, the people of Puerto Rico went from being fervently Spanish to enthusiastically American.... They humiliated themselves, giving in to the invader as the slave bows to the powerful lord.\"<ref>{{Harvnb|Negrón-Muntaner|2004|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=3bbp-8X0U9YC&printsec=frontcover&ei=Fo1tSci2FYHmkgTG_sTLBA#PPA11,M1 11]}}, citing {{citation|author=Julio Cervera Baviera|title=La defensa militar de Puerto Rico|year=1898|location=Puerto Rico|pages=79–80}}</ref> He was challenged to a [[duel]] by a group of young Puerto Ricans for writing this pamphlet.<ref>{{citation|url=http://home.coqui.net/sarrasin/pers2.htm#anchor134043|title=Protagonistas de la Guerra Hispano Americana en Puerto Rico Parte II – Comandante Julio Cervera Baviera|publisher=1898 La Guerra Hispano Americana en Puerto Rico|accessdate=February 6, 2008}} (an excerpt from {{Harvnb|Carreras|Tafunell|2004}})</ref>\n\n[[File:Well, I hardly know which to take first! 5-28-1898.JPG|thumb|A cartoon of [[Uncle Sam]] seated in restaurant looking at the bill of fare containing \"Cuba steak\", \"Porto Rico pig\", the \"Philippine Islands\" and the \"Sandwich Islands\" (Hawaii).]]\n\nCulturally, a new wave called the [[Generation of '98]] originated as a response to this trauma, marking a renaissance in Spanish culture. Economically, the war benefited Spain, because after the war large sums of capital held by Spaniards in Cuba and the United States were returned to the peninsula and invested in Spain. This massive flow of capital (equivalent to 25% of the gross domestic product of one year) helped to develop the large modern firms in Spain in the steel, chemical, financial, mechanical, textile, shipyard, and electrical power industries.<ref>Albert Carreras & Xavier Tafunell: ''Historia Económica de la España contemporánea'', p. 200–208, {{ISBN|84-8432-502-4}}.</ref> However, the political consequences were serious. The defeat in the war began the weakening of the fragile political stability that had been established earlier by the rule of [[Alfonso XII]].\n\nThe Teller Amendment, which was enacted on April 20, 1898, was a promise from the United States to the Cuban people that it was not declaring war to annex Cuba, but to help it gain its independence from Spain. The [[Platt Amendment]] was a move by the United States' government to shape Cuban affairs without violating the Teller Amendment.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://history.state.gov/milestones/1899-1913/platt|title=MILESTONES: 1899–1913 : The United States, Cuba, and the Platt Amendment, 1901|work=[https://history.state.gov/milestones Milestones]|publisher=Office of the Historian, U.S. Department of State|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150423105708/http://history.state.gov/milestones/1899-1913/platt|archivedate=April 23, 2015|df=mdy-all}}</ref>\n[[File:Puck cover2.jpg|thumb|200px|The cover of ''[[Puck (magazine)|Puck]]'' from April 6, 1901. Caricatures an [[Easter bonnet]] made out of a warship that alludes to the gains of the Spanish–American War.]]\nThe U.S. Congress had passed the [[Teller Amendment]] before the war, promising Cuban independence. However, the Senate passed the Platt Amendment as a rider to an Army [[Appropriations bill (United States)|appropriations bill]], forcing a peace treaty on Cuba which prohibited it from signing treaties with other nations or contracting a public debt. The Platt Amendment was pushed by imperialists who wanted to project U.S. power abroad (in contrast to the Teller Amendment which was pushed by anti-imperialists who called for a restraint on U.S. rule). The amendment granted the United States the right to stabilize Cuba militarily as needed. In addition, the Platt Amendment permitted the United States to deploy Marines to Cuba if its freedom and independence was ever threatened or jeopardized by an external or internal force. The Platt Amendment also provided for a permanent American naval base in Cuba. [[Guantanamo Bay Naval Base|Guantánamo Bay]] was established after the signing of the [[Cuban–American Treaty of Relations (1903)|Cuban–American Treaty of Relations]] in 1903. Thus, despite that Cuba technically gained its independence after the war ended, the United States government ensured that it had some form of power and control over Cuban affairs.\n\nThe U.S. annexed the former Spanish colonies of Puerto Rico, the Philippines and Guam. The notion of the United States as an imperial power, with colonies, was hotly debated domestically with President McKinley and the Pro-Imperialists winning their way over vocal opposition led by [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrat]] [[William Jennings Bryan]], who had supported the war. The American public largely supported the possession of colonies, but there were many outspoken critics such as [[Mark Twain]], who wrote ''[[The War Prayer]]'' in protest.\n\nRoosevelt returned to the United States a war hero, and he was soon elected [[List of Governors of New York|governor]] of New York and then  became the vice president. At the age of 42 he became the youngest man to become President after the assassination of President William McKinley.\n\n[[File:The Administration's Promises Have Been Kept.jpg|thumb|250px|1900 Campaign poster]]\nThe war served to further repair relations between the American North and South. The war gave both sides a common enemy for the first time since the end of the Civil War in 1865, and many friendships were formed between soldiers of northern and southern states during their tours of duty. This was an important development, since many soldiers in this war were the children of Civil War veterans on both sides.<ref>[http://www.geocities.com/sonsofspanamwar/CSUSVets.html Confederate & Federal Veterans of '98: Civil War Veterans who served in the Spanish–American War, Philippine Insurrection, and China Relief Expedition by Micah J.

Spokesmen noted that 33 African-American seamen had died in the ''Maine'' explosion. The most influential Black leader, [[Booker T. Washington]], argued that his race was ready to fight. War offered them a chance \"to render service to our country that no other race can\", because, unlike Whites, they were \"accustomed\" to the \"peculiar and dangerous climate\" of Cuba. One of the Black units that served in the war was the [[9th Cavalry Regiment (United States)|9th Cavalry Regiment]]. In March 1898, Washington promised the Secretary of the Navy that war would be answered by \"at least ten thousand loyal, brave, strong black men in the south who crave an opportunity to show their loyalty to our land, and would gladly take this method of showing their gratitude for the lives laid down, and the sacrifices made, that Blacks might have their freedom and rights.\"<ref>{{Harvnb|Gatewood|1975|pp=23–29}}; there were some opponents, ibid. p. 30–32.</ref>\n\nIn 1904, the [[United Spanish War Veterans]] was created from smaller groups of the veterans of the Spanish American War. Today, that organization is defunct, but it left an heir in the Sons of Spanish–American War Veterans, created in 1937 at the 39th National Encampment of the United Spanish War Veterans. According to data from the [[United States Department of Veterans Affairs]], the [[List of last living war veterans|last surviving U.S. veteran]] of the conflict, [[Nathan E. Cook]], died on September 10, 1992, at age 106. (If the data is to be believed, Cook, born October 10, 1885, would have been only 12 years old when he served in the war.)\n\nThe [[Veterans of Foreign Wars]] of the United States (VFW) was formed in 1914 from the merger of two veterans organizations which both arose in 1899: the American Veterans of Foreign Service and the National Society of the Army of the Philippines.<ref name=\"glance\">{{cite web|title=VFW at a Glance|publisher=VFW|date=September 2, 2004|url=http://www.vfw.org/resources/pdf/glance.pdf|format=PDF|accessdate=November 4, 2006|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061102012659/http://www.vfw.org/resources/pdf/glance.pdf|archivedate=November 2, 2006|df=mdy-all}}</ref> The former was formed for veterans of the Spanish–American War, while the latter was formed for veterans of the [[Philippine–American War]]. Both organizations were formed in response to the general neglect veterans returning from the war experienced at the hands of the government.\n\nTo pay the costs of the war, Congress passed an [[Federal telephone excise tax|excise tax on long-distance phone service]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.news.com/Senators-want-to-nix-1898-telecom-tax/2100-1036_3-5769948.html?tag=st.nl|title=Senators want to nix 1898 telecom tax|last=Reardon|first=Marguerite|publisher=[[CNET Networks]]|date=June 30, 2005|accessdate=February 15, 2008}}</ref> At the time, it affected only wealthy Americans who owned telephones. However, the Congress neglected to repeal the tax after the war ended four months later, and the tax remained in place for over 100 years until, on August 1, 2006, it was announced that the [[United States Department of the Treasury|U.S. Department of the Treasury]] and the [[Internal Revenue Service|IRS]] would no longer collect the tax.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.news.com/2100-1037_3-6101004.html|title=Telecom tax imposed in 1898 finally ends|last=Reardon|first=Marguerite|publisher=CNET Networks|date=August 1, 2006|accessdate=February 15, 2008}}</ref>\n\n===Postwar American investment in Puerto Rico===\n\nThe change in sovereignty of Puerto Rico, like the occupation of Cuba, brought about major changes in both the insular and U.S. economies. Before 1898 the sugar industry in Puerto Rico was in decline for nearly half a century. In the second half of the nineteenth century, technological advances increased the capital requirements to remain competitive in the sugar industry. Agriculture began to shift toward coffee production, which required less capital and land accumulation. However, these trends were reversed with U.S. hegemony. Early U.S. monetary and legal policies made it both harder for local farmers to continue operations and easier for American businesses to accumulate land.<ref>{{harvnb|Bergad|1978|pp=74–75}}.</ref> This, along with the large capital reserves of American businesses, led to a resurgence in the Puerto Rican nuts and sugar industry in the form of large American owned agro-industrial complexes.\n\nAt the same time, the inclusion of Puerto Rico into the U.S. tariff system as a customs area, effectively treating Puerto Rico as a state with respect to internal or external trade, increased the codependence of the insular and mainland economies and benefitted sugar exports with tariff protection. In 1897 the United States purchased 19.6 percent of Puerto Rico's exports while supplying 18.5 percent of its imports. By 1905 these figures jumped to 84 percent and 85 percent, respectively.<ref>{{harvnb|Bergad|1978|p=76}}.</ref> However, coffee was not protected, as it was not a product of the mainland. At the same time, Cuba and Spain, traditionally the largest importers of Puerto Rican coffee, now subjected Puerto Rico to previously nonexistent import tariffs. These two effects led to a decline in the coffee industry. From 1897 to 1901 coffee went from 65.8 percent of exports to 19.6 percent while sugar went from 21.6 percent to 55 percent.<ref>{{harvnb|Bergad|1978|p=74}}.</ref> The tariff system also provided a protected market place for Puerto Rican tobacco exports. The tobacco industry went from nearly nonexistent in Puerto Rico to a major part of the country's agricultural sector.\n\n==In film and television==\nThe Spanish–American War was the first U.S. war in which the motion picture camera played a role.<ref>[http://memory.loc.gov/ammem/sawhtml/sawhome.html The Spanish American War in Motion Picture], U.S. Library of Congress.</ref> The [[Library of Congress]] archives contain many films and film clips from the war.<ref>[http://memory.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/S?ammem/papr:@FIELD(COLLID+spanam) Early Motion Pictures, 1897–1920], U.S. Library of Congress</ref> In addition, a few feature films have been made about the war.
