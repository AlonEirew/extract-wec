The CIA never responded.{{sfn|Wright|2006|p=340}}\n\nThe same day in July, Margarette Gillespie, an FBI analyst working in the CTC, was told to review material about the Malaysia meeting. She was not told of the participants' presence in the U.S. The CIA gave Gillespie surveillance photos of Mihdhar and Hazmi from the meeting to show to FBI counterterrorism, but did not tell her their significance. The Intelink database informed her not to share intelligence material on the meeting to criminal investigators. When shown the photos, the FBI were refused more details on their significance, and also did not receive Mihdhar's date of birth or passport number.{{sfn|Wright|2006|pp=340–343}} In late August 2001, Gillespie told the [[Immigration and Naturalization Service|INS]], the State Department, the [[United States Customs Service|Customs Service]], and the FBI to put Hazmi and Mihdhar on their watchlists, but the FBI was prohibited from using criminal agents in the search for the duo, which hindered their efforts.{{sfn|Wright|2006|pp=352–353}}\n\nAlso in July, a [[Phoenix, Arizona|Phoenix]]-based FBI agent sent a message to FBI headquarters, Alec Station, and to FBI agents in New York, alerting them to \"the possibility of a coordinated effort by Osama bin Laden to send students to the United States to attend civil aviation universities and colleges.\" The agent, Kenneth Williams, suggested the need to interview all flight school managers and identify all Arab students seeking flight training.{{sfn|Wright|2006|p=350}} In July, Jordan alerted the U.S. that al-Qaeda was planning an attack on the U.S.; \"months later\", Jordan notified the U.S. that the attack's codename was \"The Big Wedding\", and that it involved airplanes.{{sfn|Yitzhak|2016|p=218}}\n\nOn August 6, the CIA's Presidential Daily Brief, designated \"For the President Only\", was entitled [[Bin Ladin Determined To Strike in US|\"Bin Ladin Determined to Strike in U.S.\"]] The memo noted that \"The FBI information... indicates patterns of suspicious activity in this country consistent with preparations for hijackings or other types of attacks.\"<ref>{{cite web|title=THE OSAMA BIN LADEN FILE: National Security Archive Electronic Briefing Book No. 343|url=http://nsarchive.gwu.edu/NSAEBB/NSAEBB343/|website=The National Security Archive|publisher=The National Security Archive|accessdate=March 14, 2016}}</ref>\n\nIn mid-August, one [[Minnesota]] flight school alerted the FBI to [[Zacarias Moussaoui]], who had asked \"suspicious questions.\" The FBI found that he was a radical who had traveled to Pakistan, and the INS arrested him for overstaying his [[France|French]] visa. Their request to search his laptop was denied by FBI headquarters due to the lack of [[probable cause]].{{sfn|Wright|2006|pp=350–351}}\n\nThe failures in intelligence-sharing were attributed to 1995 [[United States Department of Justice|Justice Department]] policies limiting intelligence sharing, combined with CIA and NSA reluctance in revealing \"sensitive sources and methods\" such as tapped phones.{{sfn|Wright|2006|pp=342–343}} Testifying before the [[9/11 Commission]] in April 2004, then-[[Attorney General]] [[John Ashcroft]] recalled that the \"single greatest structural cause for the September 11th problem was the wall that segregated or separated criminal investigators and intelligence agents.\"{{sfn|Javorsek II|Rose|Marshall|Leitner|2015|p=742}} Clarke also wrote that \"There were failures in the organizations... failures to get information to the right place at the right time...\"{{sfn|Clarke|2004|p=238}}\n\n==Attacks==\n{{Further|Timeline for the day of the September 11 attacks}}\n\n[[File:Flight paths of hijacked planes-September 11 attacks.jpg|thumb|upright=1.3|Flight paths of the four planes used on September 11]]\n\nEarly on the morning of September 11, 2001, [[Hijackers in the September 11 attacks|19 hijackers]] took control of four commercial airliners (two [[Boeing 757]] and two [[Boeing 767]]) en route to California (three headed to [[Los Angeles International Airport|LAX]] in [[Los Angeles]], and one to [[San Francisco International Airport|SFO]] in [[San Francisco]]) after takeoffs from [[Logan International Airport]] in [[Boston]], [[Massachusetts]]; [[Newark Liberty International Airport]] in [[Newark, New Jersey]]; and [[Washington Dulles International Airport]] in [[Loudoun County, Virginia|Loudoun]] and [[Fairfax County, Virginia|Fairfax]] counties in [[Virginia]].<ref name=\"911-ch1\" /> Large planes with long flights were selected for hijacking because they would be heavily fueled.<ref name=\"Chap7\" /><!--weren't early morning flights also chosen because they would have fewer passengers to overcome?-->\n\nThe four flights were:\n* [[American Airlines Flight 11]]: a Boeing 767 aircraft, departed Logan Airport at 7:59&nbsp;a.m. en route to Los Angeles with a crew of 11 and 76 passengers, not including five hijackers.

The victims were [[Andrew Goodman]] and [[Michael Schwerner|Michael \"Mickey\" Schwerner]] from [[New York City]], and [[James Chaney]] from [[Meridian, Mississippi]]. All three were associated with the [[Council of Federated Organizations]] (COFO) and its member organization the [[Congress of Racial Equality]] (CORE). They had been working with the [[Freedom Summer]] campaign by attempting to register African Americans in Mississippi to vote. This registration effort was a part of contesting over 70 years of laws and practices that supported a systematic policy of [[Disenfranchisement after the Reconstruction Era|disenfranchisement of potential black voters]] by several southern states that began in 1890.\n\nThe three men had traveled from Meridian, Mississippi, to the community of Longdale to talk with congregation members at a church that had been burned. The trio was thereafter arrested following a traffic stop outside Philadelphia, Mississippi, for speeding, escorted to the local jail and held for a number of hours.<ref name=PBS>{{cite web|title=General Article: Murder in Mississippi|url=https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/americanexperience/features/general-article/freedomsummer-murder/|website=American Experience|publisher=PBS|accessdate=14 November 2016}}</ref> As the three left town in their car, they were followed by law enforcement and others. Before leaving Neshoba County their car was pulled over and all three were abducted, driven to another location, and shot at close range. The three men's bodies were then transported to an earthen dam where they were buried.<ref name=PBS/>\n\nThe disappearance of the three men was initially investigated as a missing persons case. The civil rights workers' burnt-out car was found near a swamp three days after their disappearance.<ref>{{cite web|title=\"Mississippi Burning\" murders|url=http://www.cbsnews.com/pictures/mississippi-burning-murders/10/|publisher=CBS News|accessdate=2015-12-16}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |last1=Bayless |first1=Les|title=Three who gave their lives: Remembering the martyrs of Mississippi Freedom Summer, 1964|url=http://www.hartford-hwp.com/archives/45a/046.html|publisher=People's Weekly World|accessdate=1 December 2016}}</ref> An extensive search of the area was conducted by the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation]] (FBI), local and state authorities, and four hundred United States Navy sailors.<ref>{{cite news|title=We're Stymied, Rights Search Leaders Admit|url=https://cdnc.ucr.edu/cgi-bin/cdnc?a=d&d=DS19640701.2.18&txq=andrew+goodman |accessdate=1 December 2016|work=Desert Sun|issue=Number 283|publisher=UPI|date=1 July 1964}}</ref> The three men's bodies were only discovered two months later thanks to a tip-off.

After the state government refused to prosecute, in 1967 the United States federal government charged 18 individuals with civil rights violations. Seven were convicted and received relatively minor sentences for their actions. Outrage over the activists' disappearances helped gain passage of the [[Voting Rights Act of 1965]].<ref>{{cite book|last1=Garraty|first1=John A.|title=The Reader's Companion to American History |date=1991 |publisher=Houghton Mifflin Harcourt Publishing Company|isbn=1784027804 |url=http://www.history.com/topics/black-history/freedom-summer|accessdate=4 December 2016}}</ref>\n\nForty-one years after the murders took place, one perpetrator, [[Edgar Ray Killen]], was charged by the state of Mississippi for his part in the crimes.

Bombings, murders, vandalism, and intimidation were tactics used by [[White supremacy|white supremacists]] in order to discourage black Mississippians and their Northern supporters. In 1961 [[Freedom Riders]], who challenged the segregation of interstate buses and related facilities, were attacked on their route. In September 1962, the [[Ole Miss riot of 1962|University of Mississippi riots]] had occurred in order to prevent [[James Meredith]] from enrolling at the school.\n\nThe Mississippi White Knights of the Ku Klux Klan, a [[Ku Klux Klan]] splinter group, was founded and led by [[Samuel Bowers]] of [[Laurel, Mississippi]]. As the summer of 1964 approached, white Mississippians prepared for what they perceived was an invasion from the north. College students had been recruited in order to aid local activists who were conducting grassroots community organizing, voter registration education and drives in the state. Media reports exaggerated the number of youths expected.<ref name=\"media exaggerated\">{{cite journal|title=Murder in Mississippi|first=Don|last=Whitehead |date=September 1970 |work=Reader's Digest |page=196}}</ref> One [[Council of Federated Organizations]] (COFO) representative is quoted as saying that nearly 30,000 individuals would visit Mississippi during the summer.<ref name=\"media exaggerated\"/> Such reports had a \"jarring impact\" on white Mississippians and many responded by joining the White Knights.<ref name=\"media exaggerated\"/> More belligerent than other KKK groups, the White Knights soon attracted a following of nearly 10,000 white Mississippians.{{citation needed|date=January 2015}}\n\nIn 1890 Mississippi had passed a new constitution, supported by additional laws, which effectively excluded most black Mississippians from registering or voting. This status quo had long been enforced by economic boycotts and violence. The [[Congress of Racial Equality]] (CORE) wanted to address this problem by setting up places called [[Freedom Schools]] and starting voting registration drives in the state. Freedom schools were established in order to educate, encourage, and register the disenfranchised black citizens.<ref name=\"notification\">{{cite book |title=We Are Not Afraid|chapter=June 21, 1964 |first=Seth|last=Cagin|author2= Philip Dray |year=1988 |publisher=Bantam Books |page={{Page needed|date=March 2013}}}}</ref> CORE members James Chaney, from Mississippi, and Michael Schwerner from New York intended to set up a Freedom School for black people in Neshoba County to try to prepare them to pass the comprehension and literacy tests required by the state.\n[[File:FBI Poster of Missing Civil Rights Workers.jpg|thumb|170px|[[Missing persons]] poster created by the [[FBI]] in 1964, shows the photographs of Goodman, Chaney, and Schwerner.]]\n\n===Registering others to vote===\nOn [[Memorial Day]] 1964, Schwerner and Chaney spoke to the congregation at Mount Zion Methodist Church in Longdale, Mississippi, about setting up a Freedom School.<ref name=speech>{{cite book |title=We Are Not Afraid|chapter=June 21, 1964 |first=Seth|last=Cagin|author2=Philip Dray |year=1988 |publisher=Bantam Books |page=2}}</ref> Schwerner implored the members to register to vote, saying, \"you have been slaves too long, we can help you help yourselves\".<ref name=speech /> The White Knights learned of Schwerner's voting drive in Neshoba County and soon developed a plot to hinder the work and ultimately destroy their efforts. The White Knights wanted to lure CORE workers to Neshoba County, so they attacked congregation members and torched the church, burning it to the ground.\n\nOn June 21, 1964, Chaney, Goodman, and Schwerner met at the [[Meridian, Mississippi|Meridian]] COFO headquarters before traveling to Longdale to investigate the destruction of the Mount Zion Church. Schwerner told COFO Meridian to search for them if they were not back by 4 p.m.; he said, \"if we're not back by then start trying to locate us.\"<ref name=\"notification\"/>\n\n===Arrest===\nAfter visiting Longdale, the three civil rights workers decided not to take road 491 to return to Meridian.<ref name=\"notification\"/> The narrow country road was unpaved; abandoned buildings littered the roadside. They decided to head west on [[Mississippi Highway 16|Highway 16]] to Philadelphia, the seat of Neshoba County, then take southbound [[Mississippi Highway 19|Highway 19]] to Meridian, figuring it would be the faster route. The time was approaching three in the afternoon, and they were to be in Meridian by four.\n\nThe CORE station wagon had barely passed the Philadelphia city limits when one of its tires went flat, and Deputy Sheriff [[Cecil Price|Cecil Ray Price]] turned on his dashboard-mounted red light and followed them.<ref name=\"notification\"/> The trio stopped near the Beacon and Main Street fork.

They were taken to the Neshoba County jail on Myrtle Street, a block from the courthouse.\n\nIn the Meridian office, workers became alarmed when the 4 p.m. deadline passed without word from the three activists. By 4:45&nbsp;p.m., they notified the COFO Jackson office that the trio had not returned from Neshoba County.<ref name=\"notification\"/> The CORE workers called area authorities but did not learn anything; the contacted offices said they had not seen the civil rights workers.<ref name=\"notification\"/>\n\n==Masterminding the conspiracy==\n[[File:Mississippi KKK Conspiracy Murders June 21 1964 Parties To The Conspiracy.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Parties to the conspiracy; Top row: [[Lawrence A.

Warner, known as Pops, was a Meridian grocery owner. Warner, 54, was a member of the White Knights. Herman Tucker lived in Hope, Mississippi, a few miles from the [[Neshoba County Fair]] grounds. Tucker, 36, was not a member of the White Knights, but he was a building contractor who worked for Burrage. The White Knights gave Tucker the assignment of getting rid of the CORE station wagon driven by the workers. White Knights Imperial Wizard [[Samuel Bowers|Samuel H. Bowers]], who served with the [[U.S. Navy]] during World War II, was not apprehended on December 4, 1964, but he was implicated the following year.

Barnette, James Jordan.]]\n\nAlthough federal authorities believed there were many others who took part in the Neshoba County lynching, only ten men were charged with the physical murders of Chaney, Goodman, and Schwerner.<ref name=\"akinsbusiness\"/> One of these was the county's deputy sheriff, who played a crucial role in implementing the conspiracy. Before his friend Lawrence A. Rainey was elected sheriff in 1963, [[Cecil Price|Cecil R. Price]] worked as a salesman, bouncer, and fireman.<ref name=\"akinsbusiness\"/> Price had no prior experience in local law enforcement. The 26-year-old Price was the only person who witnessed the entire event. He arrested the three men, released them the night of the murders, and chased them down state highway 19 toward Meridian, eventually re-capturing them at the intersection near House, Mississippi. Price and the other nine men escorted them north along highway 19 to Rock Cut Road, where they forced a stop and murdered the three civil rights workers.\n\nKillen went to Meridian earlier that Sunday to organize and recruit men for the job to be carried out in Neshoba County.<ref name=organizejob>{{cite book |title=We Are Not Afraid|chapter=Rock Cut Road |author1=Seth Cagin |author2=Philip Dray |year=1988 |publisher =Bantam Books |page=278}}</ref> Before the men left for Philadelphia, Travis M. Barnette, 36, went to his Meridian home to take care of a sick family member. Barnette owned a Meridian garage and was a member of the White Knights. Alton W. Roberts, 26, was a [[dishonorably discharged]] U.S. Marine who worked as a salesman in Meridian. Roberts, standing at {{convert|6|ft|3|in|m|abbr=on}} and weighing in at {{convert|270|lbs|kg|abbr=on}}, was a formidable foe and renowned for his short temper. According to witnesses, Roberts shot both Goodman and Schwerner at point blank range. He also shot Chaney in the head after another accomplice, James Jordan, shot Chaney in the abdomen.  Roberts said \"Are you that nigger lover?\" to Schwerner, and shooting him after the latter responded, \"Sir, I know just how you feel.\" Jimmy K. Arledge, 27, and Jimmy Snowden, 31, were both Meridian commercial drivers. Arledge, a high school drop-out, and Snowden, a U.S. Army veteran, were present during the murders. After the second arrest by Price, Arledge would drive the CORE station wagon from state highway 492 to Rock Cut Road.\n\nJerry M. Sharpe, Billy W. Posey, and Jimmy L. Townsend were all from Philadelphia. Sharpe, 21, ran a pulp wood supply house. Posey, 28, a Williamsville, Mississippi automobile mechanic, owned a 1958 red and white Chevrolet; the car was considered fast and was chosen over Sharpe's. The youngest was Townsend, 17; he left high school in 1964 to work at Posey's [[Phillips 66]] garage. Horace D. Barnette, 25, was Travis' younger half-brother; he had a 1957 two-toned blue [[Ford Fairlane (Americas)|Ford Fairlane]] sedan.<ref name=\"akinsbusiness\"/> Horace Barnette's car is the one the group took after Posey's car broke down. Officials say that James Jordan, 38, killed Chaney. He confessed his crimes to the federal authorities in exchange for a plea deal.{{citation needed|date=July 2014}}\n\n===Pursuit on Highway 19===\nAfter Chaney, Goodman, and Schwerner's release from the Neshoba County jail around 10 p.m. on June 21, they were followed almost immediately by Deputy Sheriff Price in his 1957 white Chevrolet sedan patrol car.<ref name=releasedtenpm>{{cite book |title=We Are Not Afraid|chapter=Rock Cut Road |author1=Seth Cagin |author2=Philip Dray |year=1988 |publisher=Bantam Books |pages=285–286}}</ref> Soon afterward, the civil rights workers left the city limits located along Hospital Road and headed south on state Highway 19. The workers arrived at Pilgrim's store, where they may have been inclined to stop and use the telephone, but the presence of a Mississippi Highway Safety patrol car, manned by Officer Wiggs and Poe, most likely dissuaded them. They continued south toward Meridian.\n[[File:Mississippi KKK Conspiracy Murders June 21 1964 CORE Ford Station Wagon Location.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Ford Station Wagon location near the Bogue Chitto River near Highway 21 ({{coord|32|52|54.15|N|88|56|16.87|W}})]]\nThe [[Lynching|lynch mob]] members, who were in Barnette's and Posey's cars, were drinking while arguing who would kill the three young men. Eventually Philadelphia Police Officer Burkes drove up to Horace D. Barnette's car and told the group: \"They're going on 19 toward Meridian. Follow them!\" After a quick rendezvous with Philadelphia police officer Richard Willis, Price was in pursuit of the three civil rights workers.\n\nPosey's Chevrolet carried Roberts, Sharpe, and Townsend. The Chevy apparently had carburetor problems and was forced to the side of the highway. Sharpe and Townsend were ordered to stay with Posey's car and service it. Roberts transferred to Barnette's car, joining Arledge, Jordan, Posey, and Snowden.\n\nPrice eventually caught the CORE station wagon heading west toward [[Union, Mississippi]], on state highway 492. Soon he stopped them and escorted the three civil right workers north on Highway 19, back in the direction of Philadelphia. The caravan turned west on County Road 515 (also known as Rock Cut Road), and stopped at the secluded intersection of County Road 515 and County Road 284 ({{coord|32|39|40.45|N|89|2|4.13|W}}). They were shot by Jordan and Roberts. Chaney was also beaten before his death.\n\n===Disposing of the evidence===\n[[File:Mississippi KKK Conspiracy Murders June 21 1964 CORE Ford Station Wagon Location On Logging Road.jpg|thumb|right|250px|The station wagon on an abandoned logging road along Highway 21]]\nAfter the three men were shot, they were quickly loaded into their Ford station wagon and transported to Burrage's Old Jolly Farm located along [[Mississippi Highway 21|Highway 21]], a few miles southwest of Philadelphia where an earthen dam for a farm pond was under construction.

One month later, government attorneys secured indictments against the conspirators from a federal grand jury in Jackson.  On February 24, 1965, however, Federal Judge [[William Harold Cox]], an ardent segregationist, threw out the indictments against all conspirators other than Rainey and Price on the ground that the other seventeen were not acting \"under color of state law.\"  In March, 1966, the United States Supreme Court overruled Cox and reinstated the indictments.  Defense attorneys then made the argument that the original indictments were flawed because the pool of jurors from which the grand jury was drawn contained insufficient numbers of minorities.

Lawson, a member of the White House detail who acted as the advance Secret Service Agent, and Secret Service Agent Forrest V. Sorrels, Special Agent in charge of the Dallas office, were most active in planning the actual route. On November 14, both men attended a meeting at Love Field and drove over the route that Sorrels believed was best suited for the motorcade. From Love Field, the route passed through a suburban portion of Dallas, through Downtown along Main Street, and finally to the Trade Mart via a short segment of the [[Stemmons Freeway]].{{sfn|Warren|1964|loc=chpt. 2, p. 40}}\n\nThe President had planned to return to Love Field to depart for a fundraising dinner in [[Austin, Texas|Austin]] later that day. For the return trip, the agents selected a more direct route, which was approximately four miles, or 6.4 kilometers (some of this route would be used after the assassination). The planned route to the Trade Mart was widely reported in Dallas newspapers several days before the event, for the benefit of people who wished to view the motorcade.{{sfn|Warren|1964|loc=chpt. 2, p. 40}}\n\nTo pass through Downtown Dallas, a route west along Dallas' Main Street, rather than Elm Street (one block to the north) was chosen, because this was the traditional parade route, and provided the maximal building and crowd views. The route on Main Street precluded a direct turn onto the Fort Worth Turnpike exit (which served also as the Stemmons Freeway exit), which was the route to the Trade Mart, because this exit was only accessible from Elm Street. The planned motorcade route thus included a short one-block turn at the end of the downtown segment of Main Street, onto Houston Street for one block northward, before turning again west onto Elm, in order to proceed through [[Dealey Plaza]] before exiting Elm onto the Stemmons Freeway. The [[Texas School Book Depository]] was situated at the northwest corner of Houston and Elm.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://mcadams.posc.mu.edu/route.htm|title= Changed Motorcade Route in Dallas? |first= John |last=McAdams|year=2012|work= The Kennedy Assassination |publisher=Marquette University |accessdate=November 26, 2012}}</ref>\n\nThree vehicles were used for Secret Service and police protection in the Dallas motorcade.

The Commission made no conclusion as to whether this was the second or third bullet fired. The presidential limousine then passed in front of the [[John Neely Bryan]] north [[pergola]] concrete structure. The two investigative committees concluded that the second shot to hit the president entered the rear of his head (the House Select Committee placed the entry wound four inches higher than the Warren Commission placed it) and passed in fragments through his skull; this created a large, \"roughly ovular\" [sic] hole on the rear, right side. The president's blood and fragments of his scalp, brain, and skull landed on the interior of the car, the inner and outer surfaces of the front glass windshield and raised sun visors, as well as on the front engine hood and the rear trunk lid.

Largely in response to the film, Congress passed the JFK Act, or \"President John F. Kennedy Assassination Records Collection Act of 1992\". The goal of the legislation was to collect at the [[National Archives and Records Administration|National Archives]] and make publicly available all of the assassination-related records held by federal and state government agencies, private citizens and various other organizations.\n\nThe JFK Act also mandated the creation of an independent office, the [[Assassination Records Review Board]], to review the submitted records for completeness and continued secrecy. The Review Board was not commissioned to make any findings or conclusions regarding the assassination, just to collect and release all related documents. From 1994 until 1998, the Assassination Records Review Board gathered and unsealed about 60,000 documents, consisting of over 4&nbsp;million pages.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://fas.org/sgp/advisory/arrb98/part06.htm |title=Final Report of the Assassination Records Review Board, Chapter 4 |publisher=Fas.org |date=May 30, 2008 |accessdate=July 31, 2010}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://mcadams.posc.mu.edu/arrb/tunheim.htm |title=Assassination Records Review Board: Unlocking the Government's Secret Files on the Murder of a President |publisher=Mcadams.posc.mu.edu |accessdate=2010-07-31}}</ref> Government agencies requested that some records remain classified and these were reviewed under section 6 criteria of the JFK Act.

The incident took place during the [[Cold War]], and it was at first unclear whether the shooting might be part of a larger attack upon the United States. There was also concern whether Vice President Johnson, who had been riding two cars behind in the motorcade, was safe.\n\nThe news shocked the nation. People wept openly and gathered in department stores to watch the television coverage, while others prayed. Traffic in some areas came to a halt as the news spread from car to car.<ref>{{Harvnb|Associated Press|1963|page=16}}</ref> Schools across the United States dismissed their students early.<ref>{{Harvnb|Associated Press|1963|page=29}}</ref> Anger against Texas and Texans was reported from some individuals.

The bombings were followed two weeks later by [[21 July 2005 London bombings|a series of attempted attacks]] that failed to cause injury or damage. The 7 July attacks occurred the day after London had won its bid to host the [[2012 Summer Olympics|2012 Olympic Games]].\n\n==Attacks==\n{{2005 London bombings}}\n\n===London Underground===\n{{Further information|Timeline of the 2005 London bombings}}\n{{see also|Attacks on the London Underground}}\n\nAt 8:49&nbsp;am, three bombs were detonated on board London Underground trains within 50 seconds of each other:\n\n# The first bomb exploded on a six-car [[London Underground C69 and C77 Stock]] [[Circle line (London Underground)|Circle line]] sub-surface train, number 204, travelling eastbound between [[Liverpool Street station|Liverpool Street]] and [[Aldgate tube station|Aldgate]]. The train had left [[King's Cross St Pancras tube station|King's Cross St Pancras]] about eight minutes earlier. At the time of the explosion, the train's third car was approximately 100 yards (90&nbsp;m) along the tunnel from Liverpool Street. The parallel track of the [[Hammersmith & City line]] between Liverpool Street and [[Aldgate East tube station|Aldgate East]] was also damaged in the blast.\n# The second bomb exploded in the second car of another six-car London Underground C69 and C77 Stock Circle line sub-surface train, number 216, which had just left platform 4 at [[Edgware Road tube station (Circle, District and Hammersmith & City lines)|Edgware Road]] and was travelling westbound towards [[Paddington tube station (Bakerloo, Circle and District lines)|Paddington]]. The train had left King's Cross St Pancras about eight minutes previously. There were several other trains nearby at the time of the explosion; an eastbound Circle line train (arriving at platform 3 at Edgware Road from Paddington) was passing next to the bombed train and was damaged,<ref name=\"lucky-driver\">{{cite news |title=I'm lucky to be here, says driver |date=11 July 2005 |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/4671767.stm |publisher=[[BBC News]] |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061110184312/http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/4671767.stm|archivedate=10 November 2006 |deadurl=no |accessdate=12 November 2006}}</ref> as well as a wall that later collapsed. Two other trains were at Edgware Road: an unidentified train on platform 2 and a southbound Hammersmith & City line service that had just arrived at platform 1.\n# A third bomb was detonated on a 6-car [[London Underground 1973 Stock]] [[Piccadilly line]] deep-level Underground train, number 311, travelling southbound from King's Cross St Pancras to [[Russell Square tube station|Russell Square]]. The device exploded approximately one minute after the service departed King's Cross, by which time it had travelled about 500 yards (450&nbsp;m). The explosion occurred at the rear of the first car of the train—number 166—causing severe damage to the rear of that car as well as the front of the second one.<ref name=\"north-diary\">{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/4670099.stm|title=Coming together as a city|accessdate=12 November 2006|date=15 July 2005|last=North|first=Rachel|publisher=BBC}}</ref> The surrounding tunnel also sustained damage.\n\nIt was originally thought that there had been six, rather than three, explosions on the Underground network. The bus bombing brought the reported total to seven; this was clarified later in the day. The erroneous reporting can be attributed to the fact that the blasts occurred on trains that were between stations, causing wounded passengers to emerge from both stations, giving the impression that there was an incident at each. Police also revised the timings of the tube blasts: initial reports had indicated that they occurred during a period of almost half an hour. This was due to initial confusion at London Underground (LU), where the explosions were originally believed to have been caused by [[Voltage spike|power surges]]. An early report, made in the minutes after the explosions, involved a person under a train, while another described a derailment (both of which did occur, but only as a result of the explosions). A [[Code amber alert (London Underground)|code amber alert]] was declared by LU at 09:19, and LU began to cease the network's operations, ordering trains to continue only to the next station and suspending all services.<ref name=\"tube-log\">{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/england/london/4674469.stm|title=Tube log shows initial confusion|accessdate=12 November 2006|date=12 July 2005|publisher=BBC News}}</ref>\n\nThe effects of the bombs are understood to have varied due to the differing characteristics of the tunnels in which they occurred:<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/shared/spl/hi/uk/05/london_blasts/what_happened/html/russell_sq.stm|title=Indepth London Attacks|publisher=BBC News|accessdate=17 October 2009}}</ref>\n* The Circle line is a \"[[cut and cover]]\" sub-surface tunnel, about 7&nbsp;m (21&nbsp;ft) deep. As the tunnel contains two parallel tracks, it is relatively wide. The two explosions on the Circle line were probably able to vent their force into the tunnel, reducing their destructive force.\n* The Piccadilly line is a deep-level tunnel, up to 30&nbsp;m (100&nbsp;ft) below the surface and with narrow (3.56&nbsp;m, or 11&nbsp;ft&nbsp;8¼&nbsp;in) single-track tubes and just 15&nbsp;cm (6&nbsp;in) clearances. This confined space reflected the blast force, concentrating its effect.\n\n===Tavistock Square bus===\n[[File:Trapped underground.jpg|thumb|left|Passengers trapped in a carriage aboard a bombed train between [[King's Cross St Pancras tube station|King's Cross]] and [[Russell Square tube station|Russell Square]]]]\n\nAlmost one hour after the attacks on the London Underground, a fourth bomb was detonated on the top deck of a [[London Buses route 30|number 30]] [[double-decker bus]], a [[Dennis Trident 2]] (fleet number 17758, registration LX03&nbsp;BUF, two years in service at the time) operated by [[Stagecoach London]] and travelling its route from [[Marble Arch]] to [[Hackney Wick]].\n\nEarlier, the bus had passed through the [[Kings Cross, London|King's Cross area]] as it travelled from Hackney Wick to Marble Arch. At its final destination, the bus turned around and started the return route to Hackney Wick. It left Marble Arch at 9&nbsp;am and arrived at [[Euston bus station]] at 9:35&nbsp;am, where crowds of people had been evacuated from the tube and were boarding buses.\n\n[[File:7 July London bombings locations.png|right|thumb|300px|Locations of the bombings on a Central London tube map]]\nThe explosion at 9:47&nbsp;am in Tavistock Square ripped off the roof and destroyed the rear portion of the bus. The blast took place near BMA House, the headquarters of the [[British Medical Association]], on [[Upper Woburn Place]]. A number of doctors and medical staff in or near that building were able to provide immediate emergency assistance.\n\nWitnesses reported seeing \"half a bus flying through the air\". [[BBC Radio 5 Live]] and ''[[The Sun (United Kingdom)|The Sun]]'' later reported that two injured bus passengers said that they saw a man exploding in the bus.<ref name=\"campbell-laville\">{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2005/jul/13/july7.uksecurity6|title=British suicide bombers carried out London attacks, say police|first=Duncan|last=Campbell|first2=Sandra|last2=Laville|accessdate=15 November 2006|date=13 July 2005|work=[[The Guardian]]|authorlink=Duncan Campbell (The Guardian)}}</ref>\n\nThe location of the bomb inside the bus meant the front of the vehicle remained mostly intact. Most of the passengers at the front of the top deck survived, as did those near the front of the lower deck, including the driver, but those at the rear of the bus suffered more serious injuries. The extent of the damage caused to the victims' bodies resulted in a lengthy delay in announcing the death toll from the bombing while the police determined how many bodies were present and whether the bomber was one of them. Several passers-by were also injured by the explosion and surrounding buildings were damaged by debris.\n\nThe bombed bus was subsequently covered with tarpaulin and removed by low-loader for forensic examination at a secure [[Ministry of Defence (United Kingdom)|Ministry of Defence]] site. The vehicle was ultimately returned to Stagecoach and scrapped thereafter on 15 October 2009. A replacement bus, a new [[Alexander Dennis Enviro400]] (fleet number 18500, which has been changed since to 19000, registration LX55&nbsp;HGC), was named \"Spirit of London\". In October 2012, the \"Spirit of London\" bus was set alight in an arson attack.<ref name=bbcarson>{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-london-20014969|title=Suspected arson on 7/7 tribute bus 'Spirit of London'|publisher=BBC News|date=20 October 2012|accessdate=25 March 2013}}</ref> It was repaired and refurbished at a cost of £60,000 and re-entered service in April 2013.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.stagecoach.com/media/news-releases/2013/2013-23-04-spirit-of-london-relaunch.aspx|title=Stagecoach relaunches 'Spirit of London' bus following arson attack – Stagecoach Group|publisher=stagecoach.com}}</ref> Two 14-year-old girls were charged for the attack.<ref name=bbcarson/>\n\n===Victims===\n{| class=\"wikitable centre sortable\"\n|+ Deaths by nationality\n!Country\n!Number\n|-\n| {{flagu|United Kingdom}}\n! 32\n|-\n| {{flagu|Poland}}\n! 3\n|-\n| {{flagu|Vietnam}}\n! 2\n|-\n| {{flagu|Italy}}\n! 1\n|-\n| {{flagu|France}}\n! 1\n|-\n| {{flagu|Ghana}}\n! 1\n|-\n| {{flagu|Afghanistan}}\n! 1\n|-\n| {{flagu|India}}\n! 1\n|-\n| {{flagu|New Zealand}}\n! 1\n|-\n| {{flagu|Mauritius}}\n! 1\n|-\n| {{flagu|Romania}}\n! 1\n|-\n| {{flagu|Nigeria}}\n! 1\n|-\n| {{flagu|Sri Lanka}}\n! 1\n|-\n| {{flagu|Turkey}}\n! 1\n|-\n| {{flagu|Iran}}\n! 1\n|-\n| {{flagu|Grenada}}\n! 1\n|-\n| {{flagu|Israel}}\n! 1\n|-\n| {{flagu|Kenya}}\n! 1\n|-\n|- class=\"sortbottom\"\n|'''Total'''\n! 52\n|}\n\nThe 52 victims were of diverse backgrounds; among them were several foreign-born British nationals and foreign exchange students. The majority of the victims lived in or near London. Because of train delays before the attacks and subsequent transport problems caused by them, several victims died aboard trains and buses they would not normally have taken. Their ages ranged from 20 to 60 years old, with an average age of 34.\n\nAll of the victims were UK residents; 32 of them were British. One victim each came from Afghanistan, France, Ghana, Grenada, India, Iran, Israel, Italy, Kenya, Mauritius, New Zealand, Nigeria, Romania, Sri Lanka, and Turkey.

Khan detonated his bomb just after leaving Edgware Road tube station on a train travelling toward Paddington, at 8:50&nbsp;am. He lived in [[Beeston, Leeds|Beeston]], Leeds, with his wife and young child, where he worked as a learning mentor at a primary school. The blast killed seven people, including Khan himself.\n* '''[[Shehzad Tanweer]]:''' aged 22. He detonated a bomb aboard a train travelling between Liverpool Street station and Aldgate tube station, at 8:50&nbsp;am. He lived in Leeds with his mother and father, working in a fish and chip shop. Eight people, including Tanweer, were killed by the explosion.\n* '''[[Germaine Lindsay]]:''' aged 19. He detonated his device on a train travelling between King's Cross and Russell Square tube stations, at 8:50&nbsp;am. He lived in [[Aylesbury]], Buckinghamshire, with his pregnant wife and young son. His blast killed 27 people, including Lindsay himself.\n* '''[[Hasib Hussain]]:''' the youngest of the four at 18, Hussain detonated his bomb on the top deck of a double-decker bus at 9:47&nbsp;am. He lived in Leeds with his brother and sister-in-law. 14 people, including Hussain, died in the explosion in Tavistock Square.\n\nThree of the bombers were British-born sons of [[British Pakistanis|Pakistani immigrants]]; Lindsay was a [[conversion to Islam|convert]] born in [[British Jamaican|Jamaica]].\n\n[[Charles Clarke]], [[Home Secretary]] when the attacks occurred, described the bombers as \"[[cleanskin (security)|cleanskins]]\", a term describing them as previously unknown to authorities until they carried out their attacks.<ref name=\"TheTimes-2007-05-06\">\n{{cite news\n |url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/uk/article1752338.ece\n |title=The jihadi house parties of hate: Britain’s terror network offered an easy target the security sevices [sic] missed, says Shiv Malik\n |work=The Times\n |date=6 May 2007\n |accessdate=2 August 2010\n |quote=And how could Charles Clarke, home secretary at the time, claim that Khan and his associates were \"clean skins\" unknown to the security services?\n |first=Leo\n |last=Lewis\n |deadurl=yes\n |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5rhC6asKS?url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/uk/article1752338.ece\n |archivedate=3 August 2010\n |df=dmy\n}}</ref> On the day of the attacks, all four had travelled to [[Luton]], Bedfordshire, by car, then to London by train. They were recorded on CCTV arriving at [[London King's Cross railway station|King's Cross station]] at about 08:30&nbsp;am.\n\nOn 12 July 2005, the BBC reported that the [[Metropolitan Police Service]]'s anti-terrorism chief [[Deputy Assistant Commissioner]] [[Peter Clarke (police officer)|Peter Clarke]] said that property belonging to one of the bombers had been found at both the Aldgate and Edgware Road blasts.{{cn|date=January 2018}}\n\n===Videotaped statements===\nTwo of the bombers made videotapes describing their reasons for becoming what they called \"soldiers\". In a videotape broadcast by [[Al Jazeera]] on 1 September 2005, Mohammad Sidique Khan, described his motivation. The tape had been edited and mentioned [[al-Qaeda]] members [[Osama Bin Laden]], [[Ayman al-Zawahiri]] and [[Abu Musab al-Zarqawi]], describing them as \"today's heroes\". Khan's tape said:<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/4206800.stm London bomber: Text in full], BBC, 1 September 2005.

This was later ruled out by power suppliers [[National Grid plc|National Grid]]. Commentators suggested that the explanation had been made because of bomb damage to power lines along the tracks; the rapid series of power failures caused by the explosions (or power being ended by means of switches at the locations to permit evacuation) looked similar, from the point of view of a control room operator, to a cascading series of circuit breaker operations that would result from a major power surge. A couple of hours after the bombings, Home Secretary Charles Clarke confirmed the incidents were terrorist attacks.<ref>{{cite web|title=Incidents in London|url=https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/vo050707/debtext/50707-11.htm#column_465|publisher=[[United Kingdom Parliament]]|accessdate=30 July 2008}}</ref>\n\n===Security alerts===\nAlthough there were security alerts at many locations throughout the United Kingdom, no other terrorist incidents occurred outside central London. Suspicious packages were destroyed in controlled explosions in [[Edinburgh]], [[Brighton]], [[Coventry]], [[Southampton]], [[Portsmouth]], [[Darlington]] and [[Nottingham]]. Security across the country was increased to the [[UK Threat Levels|highest alert level]].\n\n''[[The Times]]'' reported on 17 July 2005 that police sniper units were following as many as a dozen al-Qaeda suspects in Britain. The covert armed teams were ordered to shoot to kill if surveillance suggested that a terror suspect was carrying a bomb and he refused to surrender if challenged. A member of the Metropolitan Police's [[Specialist Firearms Command]] said: \"These units are trained to deal with any eventuality.

Other [[cellular network|mobile phone networks]] also reported failures. The [[BBC]] speculated that the telephone system was shut down by security services to prevent the possibility of mobile phones being used to trigger bombs. Although this option was considered, it became clear later that the intermittent unavailability of both mobile and landline telephone systems was due only to excessive usage. ACCOLC was activated only in a {{convert|1|km|1|abbr=on}} radius around Aldgate Tube Station because key emergency personnel did not have ACCOLC-enabled mobile phones.<ref>{{cite web|last=McCue|first=Andy|title=7/7 bomb rescue efforts hampered by communication failings|url=http://www.zdnet.co.uk/news/networking/2006/06/05/77-bomb-rescue-efforts-hampered-by-communication-failings-39273086/|publisher=ZDNet UK|accessdate=18 April 2012}}</ref> The communications failures during the emergency sparked discussions to improve London's [[emergency communication system|emergency communications system]].<ref>{{cite web|title=London Assembly 7 July Review Committee, follow-up re port |url=http://legacy.london.gov.uk/assembly/reports/7july/follow-up-report.pdf |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120107004751/http://legacy.london.gov.uk/assembly/reports/7july/follow-up-report.pdf |dead-url=yes |archive-date=7 January 2012 |publisher=London Assembly |accessdate=18 April 2012 }}</ref>\n[[File:AvoidLondon77.jpg|left|thumb|A sign on the [[M25 motorway|M25]] London orbital road warns drivers to avoid the city.]]\n\nFor most of the day, central London's public transport system was largely out of service following the complete closure of the Underground, the closure of the Zone 1 [[List of bus routes in London|bus network]], and the evacuation of incident sites such as Russell Square. Bus services restarted at 4&nbsp;pm on 7 July, and most mainline railway stations resumed service soon afterward. [[River Thames|River]] vessels were pressed into service to provide a free alternative to overcrowded trains and buses. Local lifeboats were required to act as safety boats, including the Sheerness lifeboat from the [[Isle of Sheppey]] in Kent. Thousands of people chose to walk home or to the nearest Zone 2 bus or railway station. Most of the Underground, apart from the stations affected by the bombs, resumed service the next morning, though some commuters chose to stay at home. Affected stretches were also closed for police investigations.\n\nMuch of the King's Cross railway station was also closed, with the ticket hall and waiting area being used as a makeshift hospital to treat casualties. Although the station reopened later during the day, only suburban rail services were able to use it, with [[Great North Eastern Railway]] trains terminating at [[Peterborough railway station|Peterborough]] (the service was fully restored on 9 July). King's Cross St Pancras tube station remained available only to [[Metropolitan line]] services to facilitate the ongoing recovery and investigation for a week, though [[Victoria line]] services were restored on 15 July and the [[Northern line]] on 18 July. All the damaged trains were basically removed in stages. [[St Pancras railway station|St. Pancras station]], located next to King's Cross, was shut on the afternoon of the attacks, with all [[Midland Mainline]] trains terminating at [[Leicester railway station|Leicester]], causing disruption to services to [[Sheffield]], [[Nottingham]] and [[Derby]].\n\n[[File:Caledonian Road tube station closed.jpg|left|thumb|Underground stations, including [[Caledonian Road tube station|Caledonian Road]] (pictured), were closed across London]]\nOn 25 July, the Hammersmith & City line was reopened from Baker Street to Barking after the affected train was cleared at Aldgate, together with the stretch from Moorgate to Aldgate of the Metropolitan Line. The Hammersmith to Paddington part of the Hammersmith & City line was a shuttle service after the bombings. On the 29 July, the District line was reopened from High Street Kensington to Edgware Road, after the affected train was cleared.\n\nOn 2 August the Hammersmith & City line resumed normal service; the Circle line was still suspended, though all Circle line stations are also served by other lines. The Piccadilly line service resumed on 4 August after the affected train was cleared on 16 July, and enhanced maintenance work was done. On 4 August, Circle line was reopened again.\n\n===Economic effect===\n[[File:Headlines london bombing 7 july 2005 Waterloo station.JPG|right|thumb|160px|Headlines outside [[London Waterloo railway station|Waterloo station]]]]\nThere were limited reactions to the attack in the [[world economy]] as measured by [[financial market]] and [[exchange rate]] activity. The value of the [[Pound sterling|British pound]] decreased 0.89 cents to a 19-month low against the US dollar. The [[FTSE 100 Index]] fell by about 200 points during the two hours after the first attack. This was its greatest decrease since the [[2003 invasion of Iraq|invasion of Iraq]], and it triggered the [[London Stock Exchange]]'s 'Special Measures', restricting [[panic selling]] and aimed at ensuring market stability. By the time the market closed it had recovered to only 71.3 points (1.36%) down on the previous day's three-year closing high. Markets in France, Germany, the Netherlands and Spain also closed about 1% down on the day.\n\nUS market indexes increased slightly, partly because the dollar index increased sharply against the pound and the euro. The [[Dow Jones Industrial Average]] gained 31.61 to 10,302.29. The [[NASDAQ|NASDAQ Composite Index]] increased 7.01 to 2075.66. The [[S&P 500]] increased 2.93 points to 1197.87 after decreasing as much as 1%. Every benchmark value gained 0.3%.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=10000103&sid=aflPCIrU37Ns&refer=us|title=U.S. Stocks Rise, Erasing Losses on London Bombings; Gap Rises|first=Dune|last=Lawrence|publisher=Bloomberg L.P.|date=7 July 2005|accessdate=3 December 2006}}</ref>\n\nThe market values increased again on 8 July as it became clear that the damage caused by the bombings was not as great as thought initially. By end of trading the market had recovered fully to above its level at start of trading on 7 July. Insurers in the UK tend to [[reinsurance|reinsure]] their terrorist liabilities in excess of the first £75,000,000 with [[Pool Re]], a mutual insurer established by the government with major insurers. Pool Re has substantial reserves and newspaper reports indicated that claims would easily be funded.\n\nOn 9 July, the [[Bank of England]], [[HM Treasury]] and the [[Financial Services Authority]] revealed that they had instigated contingency plans immediately after the attacks to ensure that the UK financial markets could keep trading. This involved the activation of a \"secret chatroom\" on the British government's Financial Sector Continuity website, which allowed the institutions to communicate with the country's banks and market dealers.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/business/4666225.stm|title=Banks talked via secret chatroom|publisher=BBC News|date=8 July 2005|accessdate=3 December 2006}}</ref>\n\n===Media response===\n[[File:Kings Cross press gazebo 1.jpg|thumb|left|[[News program|TV news]] tent at [[London King's Cross railway station|King's Cross station]]]]\nContinuous news coverage of the attacks was broadcast throughout 7 July, by both [[BBC One]] and [[ITV1]], uninterrupted until 7&nbsp;p.m. [[Sky News]] did not broadcast any advertisements for 24 hours. [[ITN]] confirmed later that its coverage on ITV1 was its longest uninterrupted on-air broadcast of its 50-year history.

It was reported by [[CBS News]] that a senior Israeli official said that British police told the [[Embassy of Israel, London|Israeli embassy in London]] minutes before the explosions that they had received warnings of possible terror attacks in the UK capital. An AP report used by a number of news sites, including ''[[The Guardian]]'', attributed the initial report of a warning to an Israeli \"Foreign Ministry official, speaking on condition of anonymity\", but added Foreign Minister [[Silvan Shalom]]'s later denial on [[Israel Defense Forces Radio]]: \"There was no early information about terrorist attacks.\" A similar report on the site of right-wing Israeli paper ''Israel National News/Arutz Sheva'' attributed the story to \"Army Radio quoting unconfirmed reliable sources.\"<ref name=REPORT>[http://www.israelnationalnews.com/News/News.aspx/85346 Report: Israel was warned ahead of first blast] Arutz Sheva – {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050721080055/http://www.israelnationalnews.com/news.php3?id=85346 |date=21 July 2005 }}</ref> Although the report has been retracted, the original stories are still circulated as a result of their presence on the news websites' archives.\n* In an interview with the Portuguese newspaper ''[[Público (Portugal)|Público]]'' a month after the [[2004 Madrid train bombings]], Syrian-born cleric [[Omar Bakri Muhammad]] warned that \"a very well-organised\" London-based group which he called \"al-Qaeda Europe\" was \"on the verge of launching a big operation.\"<ref name=BAKRI>{{cite web|url=http://www.gulf-times.com/site/topics/article.asp?cu_no=2&item_no=43819&version=1&template_id=57&parent_id=56 |title=Islamic leader had warned of attack |work=Gulf Times |accessdate=17 October 2009| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20090903203004/http://www.gulf-times.com/site/topics/article.asp?cu_no=2&item_no=43819&version=1&template_id=57&parent_id=56| archivedate= 3 September 2009 | deadurl= yes}}</ref> In December 2004, Bakri vowed that, if Western governments did not change their policies, Muslims would give them \"a 9/11, day after day after day.\"<ref name=NYTJuly8/>\n* According to a 17 November 2004 post on the ''[[Newsweek]]'' website, US authorities in 2004 had evidence that terrorists were planning a possible attack in London.

It determined that the 52 victims had been unlawfully killed; their deaths could not have been prevented, and they would probably have died \"whatever time the emergency services reached and rescued them\". Hallett concluded that MI5 had not made every possible improvement since the attacks but that it was not \"right or fair\" to say more attention should have been paid to ringleader Mohammad Sidique Khan prior to 7 July.

Codenamed '''Operation Neptune''' and often referred to as '''[[D-Day (military term)|D-Day]]''', it was the largest seaborne invasion in history. The operation began the liberation of German-occupied northwestern Europe from [[Nazi Germany|Nazi]] control, and laid the foundations of the Allied victory on the [[Western Front (World War II)|Western Front]].\n\nPlanning for the operation began in 1943. In the months leading up to the invasion, the Allies conducted a substantial [[military deception]], codenamed [[Operation Bodyguard]], to mislead the Germans as to the date and location of the main Allied landings. The weather on D-Day was far from ideal and the operation had to be delayed 24 hours; a further postponement would have meant a delay of at least two weeks as the invasion planners had requirements for the phase of the moon, the tides, and the time of day that meant only a few days each month were deemed suitable. [[Adolf Hitler]] placed German [[Generalfeldmarschall|Field Marshal]] [[Erwin Rommel]] in command of German forces and of developing fortifications along the [[Atlantic Wall]] in anticipation of an Allied invasion.\n\nThe [[Amphibious warfare|amphibious landings]] were preceded by extensive aerial and naval bombardment and an [[airborne forces|airborne assault]]—the [[American airborne landings in Normandy|landing of 24,000 American]], [[Operation Tonga|British, and Canadian airborne troops shortly after midnight]]. Allied [[infantry]] and [[Armoured warfare|armoured]] [[division (military)|divisions]] began landing on the coast of France at 06:30. The target {{Convert|50|mi|km|adj=on}} stretch of the [[Normandy]] coast was divided into five sectors: [[Utah Beach|Utah]], [[Omaha Beach|Omaha]], [[Gold Beach|Gold]], [[Juno Beach|Juno]], and [[Sword Beach|Sword]]. Strong winds blew the landing craft east of their intended positions, particularly at Utah and Omaha. The men landed under heavy fire from gun emplacements overlooking the beaches, and the shore was mined and covered with obstacles such as wooden stakes, metal tripods, and barbed wire, making the work of the beach-clearing teams difficult and dangerous. Casualties were heaviest at Omaha, with its high cliffs. At Gold, Juno, and Sword, several fortified towns were cleared in house-to-house fighting, and two major gun emplacements at Gold were disabled, using specialised tanks.\n\nThe Allies failed to achieve any of their goals on the first day. [[Carentan]], [[St. Lô]], and [[Bayeux]] remained in German hands, and [[Caen]], a major objective, was not captured until 21 July. Only two of the beaches (Juno and Gold) were linked on the first day, and all five [[beachhead]]s were not connected until 12 June; however, the operation gained a foothold which the Allies gradually expanded over the coming months. German casualties on D-Day have been estimated at 4,000 to 9,000 men. Allied casualties were at least 10,000, with 4,414 confirmed dead.\n\nMuseums, memorials, and war cemeteries in the area now host many visitors each year.\n\n==Background==\nAfter the [[German Army (Wehrmacht)|German Army]] [[Operation Barbarossa|invaded the Soviet Union]] in June 1941, the [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] leader [[Joseph Stalin]] began pressing his allies for the creation of a [[Western Front (World War II)#1944–45: The Second Front|second front]] in western Europe.{{sfn|Ford|Zaloga|2009|pp=8–9}} In late May 1942 the Soviet Union and the United States made a joint announcement that a \"... full understanding was reached with regard to the urgent tasks of creating a second front in Europe in 1942.\"{{sfn|Folliard|1942}} However, British Prime Minister [[Winston Churchill]] persuaded American President [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] to postpone the promised invasion as, even with American help, the [[Allies of World War II|Allies]] did not have adequate forces for such an activity.{{sfn|Ford|Zaloga|2009|p=10}}\n\nInstead of an immediate return to France, the western Allies staged offensives in the [[Mediterranean Theatre of Operations]], where [[British Army|British troops]] were already stationed. By mid-1943 the [[Tunisia Campaign|campaign in North Africa]] had been won. The Allies then launched the [[Allied invasion of Sicily|invasion of Sicily]] in July 1943, and subsequently [[Allied invasion of Italy|invaded the Italian mainland]] in September the same year. By then, Soviet forces were on the offensive and had won a major victory at the [[Battle of Stalingrad]]. The decision to undertake a cross-channel invasion within the next year was taken at the [[Trident Conference]] in Washington in May 1943.{{sfn|Ford|Zaloga|2009|pp=10–11}} Initial planning was constrained by the number of available [[landing craft]], most of which were already committed in the Mediterranean and [[Pacific War|Pacific]].{{sfn|Wilmot|1997|pp=177–178, chart p. 180}} At the [[Tehran Conference]] in November 1943, Roosevelt and Churchill promised Stalin that they would open the long-delayed second front in May 1944.{{sfn|Churchill|1951|p=404}}\n\n[[File:Meeting of the Supreme Command, Allied Expeditionary Force, London, 1 February 1944 TR1631.jpg|thumb|300px|Meeting of the [[Supreme Headquarters Allied Expeditionary Force]] (SHAEF), 1 February 1944.

As Brittany and Cotentin are peninsulas, it would have been possible for the Germans to cut off the Allied advance at a relatively narrow isthmus, so these sites were rejected.{{sfn|Ford|Zaloga|2009|pp=13–14}} With the Pas de Calais being the closest point in [[continental Europe]] to Britain, the Germans considered it to be the most likely initial landing zone, so it was the most heavily fortified region.{{sfn|Beevor|2009|pp=33–34}} But it offered few opportunities for expansion, as the area is bounded by numerous rivers and canals,{{sfn|Wilmot|1997|p=170}} whereas landings on a broad front in Normandy would permit simultaneous threats against the port of [[Cherbourg-Octeville|Cherbourg]], coastal ports further west in Brittany, and an overland attack towards Paris and eventually into Germany. Normandy was hence chosen as the landing site.{{sfn|Ambrose|1994|pp=73–74}} The most serious drawback of the Normandy coast—the lack of port facilities—would be overcome through the development of artificial [[Mulberry harbour]]s.{{sfn|Ford|Zaloga|2009|p=14}} A series of specialised tanks, nicknamed [[Hobart's Funnies]], were created to deal with conditions expected during the Normandy Campaign, such as scaling sea walls and providing close support on the beach.{{sfn|Wilmot|1997|p=182}}\n\nThe Allies planned to launch the invasion on 1 May 1944.{{sfn|Wilmot|1997|p=170}} The initial draft of the plan was accepted at the [[Quebec Conference, 1943|Quebec Conference]] in August 1943. [[General (United States)|General]] [[Dwight D. Eisenhower]] was appointed commander of [[Supreme Headquarters Allied Expeditionary Force]] (SHAEF).{{sfn|Gilbert|1989|p=491}} [[General (United Kingdom)|General]] [[Bernard Law Montgomery, 1st Viscount Montgomery of Alamein|Bernard Montgomery]] was named as commander of the [[21st Army Group]], which comprised all of the land forces involved in the invasion.{{sfn|Whitmarsh|2009|pp=12–13}} On 31 December 1943 Eisenhower and Montgomery first saw the plan, which proposed amphibious landings by three [[Division (military)|divisions]] with two more divisions in support. The two generals immediately insisted that the scale of the initial invasion be expanded to five divisions, with airborne descents by three additional divisions, to allow operations on a wider front and speed up the capture of Cherbourg.{{sfn|Whitmarsh|2009|p=13}} The need to acquire or produce extra landing craft for the expanded operation meant that the invasion had to be delayed to June.{{sfn|Whitmarsh|2009|p=13}} Eventually, thirty-nine Allied divisions would be committed to the Battle of Normandy: twenty-two American, twelve British, three Canadian, one Polish, and one French, totalling over a million troops{{sfn|Weinberg|1995|p=684}} all under overall British command.{{sfn|Ellis|Allen|Warhurst|2004|pp=521–533}}\n\n==Operations==\n[[Operation Overlord]] was the name assigned to the establishment of a large-scale [[lodgement]] on the Continent. The first phase, the amphibious invasion and establishment of a secure foothold, was codenamed Operation Neptune.{{sfn|Ford|Zaloga|2009|p=14}} To gain the air superiority needed to ensure a successful invasion, the Allies undertook a bombing campaign (codenamed [[Operation Pointblank]]) that targeted German aircraft production, fuel supplies, and airfields.{{sfn|Ford|Zaloga|2009|p=14}} Elaborate deceptions, codenamed [[Operation Bodyguard]], were undertaken in the months leading up to the invasion to prevent the Germans from learning the timing and location of the invasion.{{sfn|Beevor|2009|p=3}}\n\nThe landings were to be preceded by airborne operations near [[Caen]] on the eastern flank to secure the [[Orne (river)|Orne River]] bridges and north of [[Carentan]] on the western flank. The Americans, assigned to land at [[Utah Beach]] and [[Omaha Beach]], were to attempt to capture Carentan and [[St. Lô]] the first day, then cut off the Cotentin Peninsula and eventually capture the port facilities at [[Cherbourg]]. The British at [[Sword Beach|Sword]] and [[Gold Beach]]es and Canadians at [[Juno Beach]] would protect the American flank and attempt to establish airfields near Caen. A secure lodgement would be established and an attempt made to hold all territory north of the [[Avranches]]-[[Falaise, Calvados|Falaise]] line within the first three weeks.{{sfn|Churchill|1951|pp=592–593}}{{sfn|Beevor|2009|loc=Map, inside front cover}} Montgomery envisaged a ninety-day battle, lasting until all Allied forces reached the River [[Seine]].{{sfn|Weinberg|1995|p=698}}\n\n==Deception plans==\n[[File:Ghost Army.jpg|thumb|left|Shoulder patches were designed for units of the fictitious [[First United States Army Group]] under George Patton]]\nUnder the overall umbrella of Operation Bodyguard, the Allies conducted several subsidiary operations designed to mislead the Germans as to the date and location of the Allied landings.{{sfn|Weinberg|1995|p=680}} [[Operation Fortitude]] included Fortitude North, a misinformation campaign using fake radio traffic to lead the Germans into expecting an attack on Norway,{{sfn|Brown|2007|p=465}} and Fortitude South, a major deception involving the creation of a fictitious [[First United States Army Group]] under Lieutenant General [[George S. Patton]], supposedly located in [[Kent]] and [[Sussex]]. Fortitude South was intended to deceive the Germans into believing that the main attack would take place at Calais.{{sfn|Beevor|2009|p=3}}{{sfn|Zuehlke|2004|pp=71–72}} Genuine radio messages from 21st Army Group were first routed to Kent via landline and then broadcast, to give the Germans the impression that most of the Allied troops were stationed there.{{sfn|Whitmarsh|2009|p=27}} Patton was stationed in England until 6 July, thus continuing to deceive the Germans into believing a second attack would take place at Calais.{{sfn|Beevor|2009|p=282}}\n\nMany of the German radar stations on the French coast were destroyed in preparation for the landings.{{sfn|Whitmarsh|2009|p=34}} In addition, on the night before the invasion, a small group of [[Special Air Service]] (SAS) operators deployed dummy paratroopers over [[Le Havre]] and [[Isigny-sur-Mer|Isigny]]. These dummies led the Germans to believe that an additional airborne landing had occurred. On that same night, in [[Operation Taxable]], [[No. 617 Squadron RAF]] dropped strips of \"window\", [[Chaff (countermeasure)|metal foil]] that caused a radar return which was mistakenly interpreted by German radar operators as a naval convoy near Le Havre. The illusion was bolstered by a group of small vessels towing [[barrage balloon]]s. A similar deception was undertaken near [[Boulogne-sur-Mer]] in the Pas de Calais area by [[No. 218 Squadron RAF]] in [[Operation Glimmer]].{{sfn|Bickers|1994|pp=19–21}}{{sfn|Beevor|2009|p=76}}\n\n==Weather==\nThe invasion planners determined a set of conditions involving the phase of the moon, the tides, and the time of day that would be satisfactory on only a few days in each month. A full moon was desirable, as it would provide illumination for aircraft pilots and have the [[Tide#Range variation: springs and neaps|highest tides]]. The Allies wanted to schedule the landings for shortly before dawn, midway between low and high tide, with the tide coming in. This would improve the visibility of obstacles on the beach, while minimising the amount of time the men would be exposed in the open.{{sfn|Whitmarsh|2009|p=31}} Eisenhower had tentatively selected 5 June as the date for the assault. However, on 4 June, conditions were unsuitable for a landing: high winds and heavy seas made it impossible to launch landing craft, and low clouds would prevent aircraft from finding their targets.{{sfn|Whitmarsh|2009|p=33}}\n\n[[File:Ddayweather.jpg|thumb|[[Surface weather analysis]] map showing [[weather front]]s on 5 June]]\n\nGroup Captain [[James Stagg]] of the [[Royal Air Force]] (RAF) met Eisenhower on the evening of 4 June. He and his meteorological team predicted that the weather would improve enough for the invasion to proceed on 6 June.{{sfn|Beevor|2009|p=21}} The next available dates with the required tidal conditions (but without the desirable full moon) would be two weeks later, from 18 to 20 June. Postponement of the invasion would have required recalling men and ships already in position to cross the Channel, and would have increased the chance that the invasion plans would be detected.{{sfn|Wilmot|1997|p=224}} After much discussion with the other senior commanders, Eisenhower decided that the invasion should go ahead on the 6th.{{sfn|Wilmot|1997|pp=224–226}} A major storm battered the Normandy coast from 19 to 22 June, which would have made the beach landings impossible.{{sfn|Whitmarsh|2009|p=33}}\n\nAllied control of the Atlantic meant German meteorologists had less information than the Allies on incoming weather patterns.{{sfn|Whitmarsh|2009|p=34}} As the ''[[Luftwaffe]]'' meteorological centre in Paris was predicting two weeks of stormy weather, many Wehrmacht commanders left their posts to attend [[Military simulation|war games]] in [[Rennes]], and men in many units were given leave.{{sfn|Ford|Zaloga|2009|p=131}} Field Marshal [[Erwin Rommel]] returned to Germany for his wife's birthday and to meet with Hitler to try to obtain more [[Panzer]]s.{{sfn|Beevor|2009|pp=42–43}}\n\n==German order of battle==\nNazi Germany had at its disposal fifty [[Division (military)|divisions]] in France and the Low Countries, with another eighteen stationed in Denmark and Norway. Fifteen divisions were in the process of formation in Germany.{{sfn|Wilmot|1997|p=144}} Combat losses throughout the war, particularly on the [[Eastern Front (World War II)|Eastern Front]], meant that the Germans no longer had a pool of able young men from which to draw. German soldiers were now on average six years older than their Allied counterparts. Many in the Normandy area were ''[[Ostlegionen]]'' (eastern legions)&nbsp;– conscripts and volunteers from Russia, Mongolia, and other areas of the Soviet Union.

He envisioned 15,000 emplacements manned by 300,000 troops, but shortages, particularly of concrete and manpower, meant that most of the strongpoints were never built.{{sfn|Ford|Zaloga|2009|p=30}} As it was expected to be the site of the invasion, the Pas de Calais was heavily defended.{{sfn|Ford|Zaloga|2009|p=30}} In the Normandy area, the best fortifications were concentrated at the port facilities at Cherbourg and [[Saint-Malo]].{{sfn|Whitmarsh|2009|p=13}} Rommel was assigned to oversee the construction of further fortifications along the expected invasion front, which stretched from the Netherlands to Cherbourg,{{sfn|Ford|Zaloga|2009|p=30}}{{sfn|Beevor|2009|p=33}} and was given command of the newly re-formed Army Group B, which included the 7th Army, the [[15th Army (Wehrmacht)|15th Army]], and the forces guarding the Netherlands.

In addition to concrete gun emplacements at strategic points along the coast, he ordered wooden stakes, metal tripods, mines, and large anti-tank obstacles to be placed on the beaches to delay the approach of landing craft and impede the movement of tanks.{{sfn|Ford|Zaloga|2009|pp=54–56}} Expecting the Allies to land at high tide so that the infantry would spend less time exposed on the beach, he ordered many of these obstacles to be placed at the [[high water mark]].{{sfn|Whitmarsh|2009|p=31}} Tangles of barbed wire, [[booby trap]]s, and the removal of ground cover made the approach hazardous for infantry.{{sfn|Ford|Zaloga|2009|pp=54–56}} On Rommel's order, the number of mines along the coast was tripled.{{sfn|Whitmarsh|2009|p=13}} The Allied [[Defence of the Reich|air offensive over Germany]] had crippled the ''Luftwaffe'' and established [[air supremacy]] over western Europe, so Rommel knew he could not expect effective air support.{{sfn|Murray|1983|p=263}} The ''Luftwaffe'' could muster only 815 aircraft{{sfn|Murray|1983|p=280}} over Normandy in comparison to the Allies' 9,543.{{sfn|Hooton|1999|p=283}} Rommel arranged for booby-trapped stakes known as ''[[Rommelspargel]]'' (Rommel's asparagus) to be installed in meadows and fields to deter airborne landings.{{sfn|Whitmarsh|2009|p=13}}\n\n==Armoured reserves==\nRommel believed that Germany's best chance was to stop the invasion at the shore. He requested that the mobile reserves, especially tanks, be stationed as close to the coast as possible. Rundstedt, Geyr, and other senior commanders objected. They believed that the invasion could not be stopped on the beaches. Geyr argued for a conventional doctrine: keeping the Panzer formations concentrated in a central position around Paris and Rouen and deploying them only when the main Allied beachhead had been identified. He also noted that, in the [[Italian Campaign (World War II)|Italian Campaign]], the armoured units stationed near the coast had been damaged by naval bombardment. Rommel's opinion was that, because of Allied air supremacy, the large-scale movement of tanks would not be possible once the invasion was under way. Hitler made the final decision, which was to leave three [[Panzer division]]s under Geyr's command and give Rommel operational control of three more as reserves. Hitler took personal control of four divisions as strategic reserves, not to be used without his direct orders.{{sfn|Ford|Zaloga|2009|p=31}}{{sfn|Whitmarsh|2009|p=15}}{{sfn|Wilmot|1997|p=192}}\n\n==Allied order of battle==\n[[File:Allied Invasion Force.jpg|thumb|D-day assault routes into Normandy]]\nCommander, SHAEF: General Dwight D.

The amphibious forces were especially vulnerable to strong enemy counter-attacks before the arrival of sufficient forces in the beachhead could be accomplished. To slow or eliminate the enemy's ability to organise and launch counter-attacks during this critical period, [[airborne forces|airborne operations]] were used to seize key objectives such as bridges, road crossings, and terrain features, particularly on the eastern and western flanks of the landing areas. The airborne landings some distance behind the beaches were also intended to ease the egress of the amphibious forces off the beaches, and in some cases to neutralise German coastal defence batteries and more quickly expand the area of the beachhead.{{sfn|Ford|Zaloga|2009|p=114}}{{sfn|Wilmot|1997|p=175}}\n\nThe US 82nd and 101st Airborne Divisions were assigned to objectives west of Utah Beach, where they hoped to capture and control the few narrow causeways through terrain that had been intentionally flooded by the Germans. Reports from Allied intelligence in mid-May of the arrival of the German [[91st Infantry Division (Wehrmacht)|91st Infantry Division]] meant the intended drop zones had to be shifted eastward and to the south.{{sfn|Ford|Zaloga|2009|p=125, 128–129}} The British 6th Airborne Division, on the eastern flank, was assigned to capture intact the bridges over the [[Caen Canal]] and River Orne, destroy five bridges over the [[Dives (river)|Dives]] {{convert|6|mi}} to the east, and destroy the [[Merville Gun Battery]] overlooking Sword Beach.{{sfn|Wilmot|1997|p=234}} [[Free French]] paratroopers from the British SAS Brigade were assigned to objectives in Brittany from 5 June until August in Operations [[Operation Dingson|Dingson]], [[Operation Samwest|Samwest]], and [[Operation Cooney|Cooney]].{{sfn|Corta|1952|p=159}}{{sfn|Corta|1997|pp=65–78}}\n\n[[BBC]] war correspondent Robert Barr described the scene as paratroopers prepared to board their aircraft:\n{{quote|Their faces were darkened with cocoa; sheathed knives were strapped to their ankles; tommy guns strapped to their waists; bandoliers and hand grenades, coils of rope, pick handles, spades, rubber dinghies hung around them, and a few personal oddments, like the lad who was taking a newspaper to read on the plane&nbsp;... There was an easy familiar touch about the way they were getting ready, as though they had done it often before. Well, yes, they had kitted up and climbed aboard often just like this – twenty, thirty, forty times some of them, but it had never been quite like this before. This was the first combat jump for every one of them.{{sfn|Barr|1944}} }}\n\n====American airborne landings====\n{{Main|American airborne landings in Normandy}}\n[[File:US glider reinforcements arrive on D-Day 1944.jpg|thumb|Gliders are delivered to the Cotentin Peninsula by [[Douglas C-47 Skytrain]]s. 6 June 1944]]\nThe American airborne landings began with the arrival of [[Pathfinder (military)|pathfinders]] at 00:15.

Many planes came in so low that they were under fire from both [[flak]] and machine gun fire. Some paratroopers were killed on impact when their parachutes did not have time to open, and others drowned in the flooded fields.{{sfn|Beevor|2009|pp=61–64}} Gathering together into fighting units was made difficult by a shortage of radios and by the [[bocage]] terrain, with its [[hedgerow]]s, stone walls, and marshes.{{sfn|Ford|Zaloga|2009|pp=166–167}}{{sfn|Beevor|2009|p=116}} Some units did not arrive at their targets until afternoon, by which time several of the causeways had already been cleared by members of the 4th Infantry Division moving up from the beach.{{sfn|Ford|Zaloga|2009|p=139}}\n\nTroops of the 82nd Airborne began arriving around 02:30, with the primary objective of capturing two bridges over the River [[Merderet]] and destroying two bridges over the Douve.{{sfn|Wilmot|1997|p=243}} On the east side of the river, 75 per cent of the paratroopers landed in or near their drop zone, and within two hours they captured the important crossroads at [[Sainte-Mère-Église]] (the first town liberated in the invasion{{sfn|Beevor|2009|p=67}}) and began working to protect the western flank.{{sfn|Wilmot|1997|p=244}} Because of the failure of the pathfinders to accurately mark their drop zone, the two regiments dropped on the west side of the Merderet were extremely scattered, with only four per cent landing in the target area.{{sfn|Wilmot|1997|p=244}} Many landed in nearby swamps, with much loss of life.{{sfn|Ford|Zaloga|2009|p=145}} Paratroopers consolidated into small groups, usually a combination of men of various ranks from different units, and attempted to concentrate on nearby objectives.{{sfn|Beevor|2009|p=69}} They captured but failed to hold the Merderet River bridge at La Fière, and fighting for the crossing continued for several days.{{sfn|Ford|Zaloga|2009|pp=149–150}}\n\nReinforcements arrived by [[military glider|glider]] around 04:00 ([[Mission Chicago]] and [[Mission Detroit]]), and 21:00 ([[Mission Keokuk]] and [[Mission Elmira]]), bringing additional troops and heavy equipment. Like the paratroopers, many landed far from their drop zones.{{sfn|Ford|Zaloga|2009|p=151}} Even those that landed on target experienced difficulty, with heavy cargo such as [[Willys MB|Jeeps]] shifting during landing, crashing through the wooden fuselage, and in some cases crushing personnel on board.{{sfn|Beevor|2009|p=71}}\n\nAfter 24 hours, only 2,500 men of the 101st and 2,000 of the 82nd Airborne were under the control of their divisions, approximately a third of the force dropped. This wide dispersal had the effect of confusing the Germans and fragmenting their response.{{sfn|Ford|Zaloga|2009|p=167}} The 7th Army received notification of the parachute drops at 01:20, but Rundstedt did not initially believe that a major invasion was underway. The destruction of radar stations along the Normandy coast in the week before the invasion meant that the Germans did not detect the approaching fleet until 02:00.{{sfn|Wilmot|1997|p=246–247}}\n\n====British and Canadian airborne landings====\n{{Main|Operation Tonga}}\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 146-2004-0176, Normandie, zerstörter Lastensegler.jpg|left|thumb|An abandoned [[Waco CG-4]] glider is examined by German troops]]\nThe first Allied action of D-Day was [[Operation Deadstick]], a glider assault at 00:16 at [[Pegasus Bridge]] over the Caen Canal and the bridge (since renamed [[Horsa Bridge]]) over the Orne, half a mile (800 metres) to the east.

In the [[Battle of Merville Gun Battery]], Allied forces disabled the guns with plastic explosives at a cost of 75 casualties. The emplacement was found to contain 75&nbsp;mm guns rather than the expected 150&nbsp;mm heavy coastal artillery. Otway's remaining force withdrew with the assistance of a few members of the [[1st Canadian Parachute Battalion]].{{sfn|Beevor|2009|pp=56–58}}\n\nWith this action, the last of the D-Day goals of the British 6th Airborne Division was achieved.{{sfn|Wilmot|1997|p=242}} They were reinforced at 12:00 by commandos of the [[1st Special Service Brigade]], who landed on Sword Beach, and by the [[6th Airlanding Brigade (United Kingdom)|6th Airlanding Brigade]], who arrived in gliders at 21:00 in [[Operation Mallard]].{{sfn|Ford|Zaloga|2009|loc=Map, pp. 216–217}}\n\n===Tank landings===\nSome of the landing craft had been modified to provide close support fire, and self-propelled amphibious Duplex-Drive tanks ([[DD tank]]s), specially designed for the Normandy landings, were to land shortly before the infantry to provide covering fire.

This site turned out to be better, as there was only one strongpoint nearby rather than two, and bombers of [[IX Bomber Command]] had bombed the defences from lower than their prescribed altitude, inflicting considerable damage. In addition, the strong currents had washed ashore many of the underwater obstacles. The assistant commander of the 4th Infantry Division, Brigadier General [[Theodore Roosevelt, Jr.]], the first senior officer ashore, made the decision to \"start the war from right here\", and ordered further landings to be re-routed.{{sfn|Ford|Zaloga|2009|pp=131, 160–161}}{{sfn|Whitmarsh|2009|pp=50–51}}\n\nThe initial assault battalions were quickly followed by 28 DD tanks and several waves of engineer and demolition teams to remove beach obstacles and clear the area directly behind the beach of obstacles and mines.

The beach quickly became congested.{{sfn|Beevor|2009|p=143}} Brigadier [[Simon Fraser, 15th Lord Lovat]] and his 1st Special Service Brigade arrived in the second wave, [[bagpipes|piped ashore]] by Private [[Bill Millin]], Lovat's personal piper.{{sfn|Beevor|2009|p=138}} Members of [[No. 4 Commando]] moved through [[Ouistreham]] to attack from the rear a German gun battery on the shore. A concrete observation and control tower at this emplacement had to be bypassed and was not captured until several days later.{{sfn|Ford|Zaloga|2009|pp=244–245}} French forces under Commander [[Philippe Kieffer]] (the first French soldiers to arrive in Normandy) attacked and cleared the heavily fortified strongpoint at the casino at Riva Bella, with the aid of one of the DD tanks.{{sfn|Ford|Zaloga|2009|pp=244–245}}\n\nThe 'Morris' strongpoint near [[Colleville-sur-Mer]] was captured after about an hour of fighting.{{sfn|Beevor|2009|p=143}} The nearby 'Hillman' strongpoint, headquarters of the 736th Infantry Regiment, was a large complex defensive work that had come through the morning's bombardment essentially undamaged. It was not captured until 20:15.{{sfn|Ford|Zaloga|2009|pp=248–249}} The 2nd Battalion, [[King's Shropshire Light Infantry]] began advancing to Caen on foot, coming within a few kilometres of the town, but had to withdraw due to lack of armour support.{{sfn|Beevor|2009|pp=143, 148}} At 16:00, the 21st Panzer Division mounted a counter-attack between Sword and Juno and nearly succeeded in reaching the Channel.

German preparations along the Atlantic Wall were only partially finished; shortly before D-Day Rommel reported that construction was only 18 per cent complete in some areas as resources were diverted elsewhere.{{sfn|Wilmot|1997|p=290}} The deceptions undertaken in Operation Fortitude were successful, leaving the Germans obliged to defend a huge stretch of coastline.{{sfn|Ford|Zaloga|2009|p=343}} The Allies achieved and maintained [[air supremacy]], which meant that the Germans were unable to make observations of the preparations underway in Britain and were unable to interfere via bomber attacks.{{sfn|Wilmot|1997|p=289}} Infrastructure for transport in France was severely disrupted by Allied bombers and the French Resistance, making it difficult for the Germans to bring up reinforcements and supplies.{{sfn|Ford|Zaloga|2009|p=36}} Some of the opening bombardment was off-target or not concentrated enough to have any impact,{{sfn|Beevor|2009|p=91}} but the specialised armour worked well except on Omaha, providing close artillery support for the troops as they disembarked onto the beaches.{{sfn|Wilmot|1997|p=291}} Indecisiveness and an overly complicated command structure on the part of the German high command were also factors in the Allied success.{{sfn|Wilmot|1997|p=292}}\n\n==War memorials and tourism==\n[[File:Beny-sur-Mer Cemetery.jpg|thumb|The [[Bény-sur-Mer Canadian War Cemetery]]]]\n[[File:Cimetière allemand de La Cambe - pano.jpg|thumb|The [[La Cambe German war cemetery]], near Bayeux]]\n\nAt Omaha Beach, parts of the Mulberry harbour are still visible, and a few of the beach obstacles remain.
