The annual presentation ceremony features performances by prominent artists, and the presentation of those awards that have a more popular interest. It shares recognition of the music industry as that of the other performance awards such as the [[Academy Awards]] (film), the [[Emmy Award]]s (television), and the [[Tony Award]]s (theater).\n\nThe [[1st Annual Grammy Awards|first Grammy Awards ceremony]] was held on May 4, 1959, to honor and respect the musical accomplishments by performers for the year 1958. Following the 2011 ceremony, [[The Recording Academy|the Academy]] overhauled many Grammy Award categories for 2012. \n\nThe [[60th Annual Grammy Awards]], honoring the best achievements from October 1, 2016 to September 30, 2017 were held on January 28, 2018 at  [[Madison Square Garden]] in New York City.\n\n==History==\nThe Grammys had their origin in the [[Hollywood Walk of Fame]] project in the 1950s.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://projects.latimes.com/hollywood/star-walk/about/|title=Hollywood Walk of Fame History|work=Los Angeles Times|accessdate=May 21, 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.walkoffame.com/pages/history|title=Hollywood Walk of Fame History|publisher=Hollywood Walk of Fame|accessdate=May 21, 2011}}</ref> As the recording executives chosen for the Walk of Fame committee worked at compiling a list of important recording industry people who might qualify for a Walk of Fame star, they realized there were many more people who were leaders in their business who would never earn a star on [[Hollywood Boulevard]]. The music executives decided to rectify this by creating an award given by their industry similar to the [[Oscars]] and the [[Emmy Award|Emmys]]. This was the beginning of the [[National Academy of Recording Arts and Sciences]]. After it was decided to create such an award, there was still a question of what to call it; one working title was the Eddie, to honor the inventor of the phonograph, [[Thomas Edison]]. They finally settled on using the name of the invention of [[Emile Berliner]], the [[Phonograph|gramophone]], for the awards, which were first given for the year 1958.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=NnRPAAAAIBAJ&sjid=5wQEAAAAIBAJ&pg=1440,1446700&dq=paul+weston&hl=en|title=Record Academy Plans TV Spectacular of Its Own|author=Thomas, Bob|date=April 8, 1959|publisher=Ocala Star-Banner|accessdate=January 29, 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=ca9NAAAAIBAJ&sjid=cEgDAAAAIBAJ&pg=7065,1739274&dq=paul+weston&hl=en|title=Recording Stars Plan Eddie To Join Oscar And Emmy|date=August 9, 1957|publisher=The Deseret News|accessdate=February 2, 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=aSBAAAAAIBAJ&sjid=Z1gMAAAAIBAJ&pg=3612,4838071&dq=paul+weston+grammy&hl=en|title=Bronze Stars Begot Grammy|date=February 22, 1976|publisher=The Robesonian|accessdate=May 2, 2011}}</ref>\n\nThe [[1st Annual Grammy Awards|first award ceremony]] was held simultaneously in two locations on May 4, 1959 - Beverly Hilton Hotel in Beverly Hills California, and Park Sheraton Hotel in New York City,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.awardsandshows.com/features/grammy-awards-1959-may-238.html |title=Grammy Awards 1959 (May) |work=Grammy }}</ref> and 28 Grammys were awarded.

Special awards are given for longer-lasting contributions to the music industry.\n\nBecause of the large number of award categories (78 in 2012, 81 in 2013 and 82 in 2014), and the desire to feature several performances by various artists, only the ones with the most popular interest - typically about 10 to 12, including the four General Field categories and one or two categories in the most popular music genres (i.e. pop, rock, country, rap) - are presented directly at the televised award ceremony. The many other Grammy trophies are presented in a pre-telecast 'Premiere Ceremony' earlier in the afternoon before the Grammy Awards telecast.\n\n===2012 category restructuring===\n{{refimprove|section|date=May 2017}}\n\nOn April 6, 2011, The Recording Academy announced a drastic overhaul of many Grammy Award categories for 2012.<ref>[https://www.grammy.org/recording-academy/press-release/apr-06-2011-914-am Grammy.org, 6 June 2011]</ref> The number of categories was cut from 109 to 78. The most important change was the elimination of the distinction between male and female soloists and between collaborations and duo/groups in various genre fields (pop, rock, R&B, country, and rap). Also, several categories for instrumental soloists were discontinued. Recordings in these categories now fall under the general categories for best solo performances.\n\nIn the [[Rock music|rock]] field, the separate categories for hard rock and metal albums were combined and the [[Best Rock Instrumental Performance]] category was eliminated due to a waning number of entries.\n\nIn [[R&B]], the distinction between best contemporary R&B album and other R&B albums has been eliminated. They now feature in one, general [[Best R&B Album]] category.\n\nIn [[rap music|rap]], the categories for best rap soloist and best rap duo or group have been merged into the new [[Best Rap Performance]] category.\n\nThe most eliminations occurred in the [[American folk music|roots]] category. Up to and including 2011, there were separate categories for various regional American music forms, such as Hawaiian music, Native American music and Zydeco/Cajun music. Due to the consistently low number of entries for these categories, The Recording Academy decided to combine all these music variations into the new [[Best Regional Roots Music Album]], including [[polka]], which lost its own separate category in 2009.<ref name=CBC>{{cite news|publisher=[[CBC News]] |title=Grammy board axes polka category to stay 'relevant and responsive' |url=http://www.cbc.ca/arts/music/story/2009/06/04/grammy-changes-polka-ostanek.html?ref=rss |date=June 4, 2009 |accessdate=July 20, 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090610190520/http://www.cbc.ca/arts/music/story/2009/06/04/grammy-changes-polka-ostanek.html?ref=rss |archivedate=June 10, 2009 }}</ref><ref name=\"NYT090605\">{{cite news|first=Ben|last=Sisario|work=[[The New York Times]]|title=Polka Music Is Eliminated as Grammy Award Category |page=C5 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/06/05/arts/music/05polk.html|date=June 5, 2009 |accessdate=October 18, 2010 |publisher=[[The New York Times Company]]}}</ref>\n\nIn the same genre field, the traditional and contemporary blues categories and the traditional and contemporary folk categories each were consolidated into one per genre, due to the number of entries and given the challenges in distinguishing between contemporary folk and Americana, and contemporary and traditional blues. In the world music genre field, the traditional and contemporary categories also merged.\n\nIn the [[Classical music|classical]] genre field, its main category [[Best Classical Album]] was discontinued because most recipients in this category had also won in one of the other classical categories for the same album. Classical recordings are now eligible for the main [[Grammy Award for Album of the Year|Album of the Year]] category.\n\nThere were also a few minor name changes to better reflect the nature of the separate categories. It was determined by the Recording Academy that the word \"gospel\" in the [[Gospel music|gospel]] genre field tends to conjure up the images and sounds of traditional soul gospel and leaves out the current contemporary Christian music (CCM). Therefore, the genre field and some categories were renamed as Gospel/Contemporary Christian Music.<ref>[https://www.grammy.com/news/the-academy-continues-evolution-of-grammy-awards-process Grammy announcement, 6 April 2011]</ref>\n\nSince 2012, there have been a small number of adjustments made to the list of categories and genre fields. The number of categories has gone up from 78 in 2012 to 84 in 2017.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.grammy.com/grammys/news/60th-grammy-awards-full-nominees-list|title=See The Full List Of 60th GRAMMY Nominees|date=2017-11-27|work=GRAMMY.com|access-date=2017-12-08|language=en}}</ref>\n\n==Entry process and selection of nominees==\nMedia companies registered with the National Academy of Recording Arts and Sciences and individual members of NARAS (artists and other professionals working in the industry who meet certain criteria) may enter recordings for consideration. Entries are made online and a physical copy of the work is sent to NARAS. Once a work is entered, reviewing sessions are held, involving more than 150 experts from the recording industry, to determine whether the work is entered in the correct category.\n\nThe resulting lists of eligible entries are circulated to Voting Members, each of whom may vote to nominate in the general fields ([[Grammy Award for Record of the Year|Record of the Year]], [[Grammy Award for Album of the Year|Album of the Year]], [[Grammy Award for Song of the Year|Song of the Year]], and [[Grammy Award for Best New Artist|Best New Artist]]) and in no more than nine out of 30 other fields on their ballots. The five recordings that earn the most votes in each category become the nominees, while in some categories (craft and specialized categories) there are review committees in place that determine the final 5 nominees.<ref name=\"VotingProcess\">{{cite web | url=https://www.grammy.org/recording-academy/awards/grammy-awards-voting-process | title=Grammy Awards Voting Process | accessdate=January 17, 2014}}</ref> There may be more than five nominees if there is a tie in the nomination process.\n\nWhereas members of the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences are generally invited to screenings or are sent DVDs of films nominated for Oscars, NARAS members do not receive nominated recordings. Instead, they receive access to a private online listening function.\n\n==Final voting==\nAfter nominees have been determined, final voting ballots are sent to NARAS voting members, who may then vote in the general fields and in no more than nine of the 30 fields. Members are encouraged, but not required, to vote only in their fields of expertise. Ballots are tabulated secretly by the major independent accounting firm [[Deloitte Touche Tohmatsu]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.grammy.com/GRAMMY_Awards/Voting/ |title=Grammy Awards Voting Process |publisher=grammy com |accessdate=August 28, 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100820040650/https://www2.grammy.com/grammy_awards/voting/ |archivedate=August 20, 2010 |df=mdy-all }}</ref> Following the tabulation of votes the winners are announced at the Grammy Awards. The recording with the most votes in a category wins and it is possible to have a tie (in which case the two or more nominees who tie are all considered winners). Winners are presented with the Grammy Award and those who do not win are given a medal for their nomination.\n\nIn both voting rounds, Academy members are required to vote based upon quality alone, and not to be influenced by sales, chart performance, personal friendships, regional preferences or company loyalty. The acceptance of gifts is prohibited. Members are urged to vote in a manner that preserves the integrity of the Academy and their member community. Although registered media companies may submit entries they may not vote in either round of voting.\n\nThe eligibility period for the 60th Annual Grammy Awards was October 1, 2016 to September 30, 2017.\n\n==Special Awards==\n\n'''Salute To Industry Icons Award''' \n* [[Clive Davis]] (2009)\n\n* [[L.A.

Originally [[New York City]] and [[Los Angeles]] were the host cities. [[Chicago]] joined being a host city in 1962, and then [[Nashville]] became the fourth location in 1965.\n\nThe 1971 ceremony, held at the [[Hollywood Palladium]] in Los Angeles, was the first to take place in one location. The ceremony was then moved to [[Madison Square Garden]]'s [[Felt Forum]] in New York City, and then Nashville's [[Tennessee Theatre (Nashville)|Tennessee Theatre]] in the following two years. Then from 1974 to 2003, the Grammys were held in various venues in New York City and Los Angeles. Notable locations included New York City's Madison Square Garden and [[Radio City Music Hall]]; and Los Angeles's [[Shrine Auditorium]], the [[Staples Center]] and the Hollywood Palladium.\n\nIn 2004, the Staples Center became the permanent home of the award ceremonies. [[The Grammy Museum]] was built across the street from Staples Center in [[LA Live]] to preserve the history of the Grammy Awards. Embedded on the sidewalks at the museum streets are bronze disks, similar to the [[Hollywood Walk of Fame]], honoring each year's top winners, Record of the Year, Best New Artist, Album of the Year, and Song of the Year.

Unfortunately, the awards show has become a series of hypocrisies and contradictions, leaving me to question why any contemporary popular artist would even participate. [...] While there is no doubt in my mind of the artistic talents of [[Steely Dan]] or [[Herbie Hancock]], we must acknowledge the massive cultural impact of Eminem and Kanye West and how their music is shaping, influencing and defining the voice of a generation. It is this same cultural impact that acknowledged the commercial and critical success of [[Michael Jackson]]'s ''[[Thriller (Michael Jackson album)|Thriller]]'' in 1984.<ref name=\"Stoute\"/>}}The Grammys' eligibility period – which runs from October 1 to September 30 each year<ref>{{Cite web|title = FAQs|url = https://www.grammy.org/recording-academy/awards/voting-process/faqs#two|website = The GRAMMYs|access-date = February 16, 2016}}</ref> – is also a perennial source of complaints and confusion. Because records that are released in the last quarter of a given year are not eligible for that year's awards, fans often think a favorite artist has been snubbed (e.g., Adele, whose ''25'' was released in November 2015 and so was not nominated that year despite massive sales<ref>{{Cite web|title = Adele Grammys Snub: Why Wasn't She Nominated for 2016 Awards for '25'|url = http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/adele-grammys-snub-why-wasnt-846425|website = The Hollywood Reporter|access-date = February 16, 2016}}</ref>). Conversely, the same issue means that the Grammys often recognize work that no longer feels current by the time it wins. Taylor Swift's ''1989'', for example, won Album of the Year in 2016, even though the album was released in October 2014. The same was the case with [[Adele]]’s [[25 (Adele album)|25]]. It was released in November 2015 but received the award in 2017.<ref>{{Cite web|title = The Truth Behind This Year's Maddening Grammy Nominations|url = https://www.buzzfeed.com/brianmcmanus/the-truth-behind-this-years-maddening-grammy-nominations#.qyONGwObxO|website = BuzzFeed|access-date = February 16, 2016}}</ref>\n\nThe Grammys have also been criticized for being unfavorable and racist to black recording artists. Canadian artist [[Drake (musician)|Drake]] criticized the awards in a 2017 interview for seeing him only as a rapper and not as a pop-music artist because of his previous work and because of his heritage. He criticized the snubbing of \"[[One Dance]]\" for the prestigious award of Record of the Year and the nomination of \"[[Hotline Bling]]\" for [[Grammy Award for Best Rap Song|Best Rap Song]] and [[Grammy Award for Best Rap/Sung Performance|Best Rap/Sung Performance]] despite it not being a rap song, using it as evidence of The Recording Academy only seeing black artists as capable of producing rap music.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://nationofbillions.com/drake-meets-semtex-for-more-talk|title=Drake Meets Semtex For More Talk|newspaper=A Nation of Billions|access-date=February 19, 2017}}</ref> During the 2017 show, Adele pointedly broke the 'stunt trophy' for Album of the Year in half onstage and gave half to [[Beyoncé]], stating she felt that she didn't deserve to win over the latter's ''[[Lemonade (Beyoncé album)|Lemonade]]''.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.complex.com/music/2017/02/adele-grammy-award-broken-beyonce|title=The Real Story Behind Adele Breaking Her Grammy for Beyoncé|last=(no last name)|first=Khal|date=13 February 2017|work=[[Complex (magazine)|Complex]]|accessdate=1 February 2018}}</ref> ''[[The Atlantic]]''{{'}}s Spencer Kornhaber accused the Grammys of \"sidelining a black visionary work in favor of a white traditionalist one\".<ref>{{Cite web|title=Adele, Beyoncé, and the Grammys' Fear of Progress |url=https://www.theatlantic.com/entertainment/archive/2017/02/adele-beyonce-grammys-album-of-the-year-progress-25-lemonade/516426/ |last=Kornhaber |first=Spencer |website = [[The Atlantic]] |date=February 13, 2017 |access-date=March 25, 2017}}</ref> Drake and Frank Ocean were vocal about boycotting the Grammy Awards, Drake had a performance in Manchester, England on February 12, 2017, the same night as the Awards Ceremony.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.billboard.com/articles/news/grammys/7670151/drake-missing-grammys-justin-bieber-kanye-west|title=Drake Won't Be at the Grammy Awards|work=Billboard|access-date=2017-07-24}}</ref>\n\nThe Grammys have also received criticism for their treatment of female artists. Notably at the 60th Grammy Awards, New Zealand electropop singer-songwriter [[Lorde]] make media headlines after turning down an offer to perform at the ceremony. She claimed that she was invited to perform alongside several other artists in a tribute to [[Tom Petty]] but was refused a solo slot, despite being nominated for the [[Grammy Award for Album of the Year|Album of the Year]] Award and stated that each of the male nominees were allowed solo performances. Lorde's mother also criticised the Grammys, pointing out an article which stated that only nine percent of nominees at the previous six Grammy Awards were women<ref>http://www.nme.com/news/music/heres-lorde-turned-grammy-performance-2230515</ref>. Following the 60th ceremony, many media outlets reported that the ceremony had failed women, specifically pointing to the fact that the most nominated female artist [[SZA (singer)|SZA]] did not win in any of her five nominated categories and the [[Best Pop Solo Performance]] category which was composed of four female nominees yet was won by [[Ed Sheeran]] <ref>http://www.thefader.com/2018/01/29/grammys-essay-women-artists-2018</ref>. In an interview, [[Neil Portnow]], President of the Recording Academy attracted controversy by stating that female artists need to \"step up\" in order to win awards. Portnow's comments drew criticism from many female musicians including [[Pink (singer)|Pink]], [[Katy Perry]], [[Vanessa Carlton]], [[Sheryl Crow]], [[Iggy Azalea]], [[Halsey (singer)|Halsey]] and [[Charli XCX]]<ref>https://www.theguardian.com/music/2018/jan/30/pink-sheryl-crow-slam-grammys-neil-portnow-women-step-up</ref>.\n\n==TV broadcasts and ratings==\nPrior to the first live Grammys telecast in 1971 on [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]], a series of filmed annual specials in the 1960s called ''The Best on Record'' were broadcast on [[NBC]]. The first Grammy Award telecast took place on the night of November 29, 1959, as an episode of the NBC anthology series ''[[NBC Sunday Showcase]]'', which was normally devoted to plays, original TV dramas, and variety shows. Until 1971, awards ceremonies were held in both New York and Los Angeles, with winners accepting at one of the two. [[Pierre Cossette]] bought the rights to broadcast the ceremony from the National Academy of Recording Arts and Sciences and organized the first live telecast.<ref>{{cite book|first=Ken |last=Ehrlich |title=At The Grammys: Behind the Scenes at Music's Biggest Night |publisher=Hal Leonard Books |year=2007 |isbn=978-1-4234-3073-5}}</ref> [[CBS]] bought the rights in 1973 after moving the ceremony to [[Nashville]], [[Tennessee]]; the [[American Music Award]]s were created for ABC (by [[Dick Clark]]) as a result.\n\nThe Recording Academy announced on June 21, 2011 that it had reached a new deal with CBS to keep the awards show on the network for another 10 years.

Fifteen statuettes were awarded, honoring artists, directors and other participants in the film-making industry of the time, for their works during the 1927–28 period. The ceremony ran for 15&nbsp;minutes.\n\nWinners were announced to media three months earlier. That was changed for the second ceremony in 1930. Since then, for the rest of the first decade, the results were given to newspapers for publication at 11:00&nbsp;pm on the night of the awards.<ref name=\"history\" /> This method was used until an occasion when the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' announced the winners before the ceremony began; as a result, the Academy has, since 1941, used a sealed envelope to reveal the name of the winners.<ref name=\"history\" />\n\n===Institutions===\nThe first Best Actor awarded was [[Emil Jannings]], for his performances in ''[[The Last Command (1928 film)|The Last Command]]'' and ''[[The Way of All Flesh (1927 film)|The Way of All Flesh]]''. He had to return to Europe before the ceremony, so the Academy agreed to give him the prize earlier; this made him the first Academy Award winner in history. At that time, the winners were recognized for all of their work done in a certain category during the qualifying period; for example, Jannings received the award for two movies in which he starred during that period, and [[Janet Gaynor]] later won a single Oscar for performances in three films. With the fourth ceremony, however, the system changed, and professionals were honored for a specific performance in a single film. For the first six ceremonies, the eligibility period spanned two calendar years.<ref name=\"history\" />\n\nAt the 29th ceremony, held on March 27, 1957, the [[Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film|Best Foreign Language Film]] category was introduced. Until then, foreign-language films had been honored with the Special Achievement Award.\n\nThe 74th Academy Awards, held in 2002, presented the first [[Academy Award for Best Animated Feature]].\n\nSince 1973, all Academy Awards ceremonies have ended with the [[Academy Award for Best Picture]].\n\nTraditionally, the actors present the awards for actresses, and the actresses present the awards for actors.\n\n==Oscar statuette==\n\n===Other awards presented by the Academy===\n:''See also {{section link| |Special categories}} (below).''\nIn addition to the Academy Award of Merit (Oscar award), there are nine honorary (non-competitive) awards presented by the Academy from time to time (except for the Academy Honorary Award, the Technical Achievement Award, and the Student Academy Awards, which are presented annually):\n* [[Governors Awards]]:\n** The [[Academy Honorary Award]] (annual) (which may or may not be in the form of an Oscar statuette); <!-- See [[Governors Awards#Description and history]]). -->\n** The [[Irving G.

It is the culmination of the film awards season, which usually begins during November or December of the previous year. This is an elaborate extravaganza, with the invited guests walking up the red carpet in the creations of the most prominent fashion designers of the day. [[Black tie]] dress is the most common outfit for men, although fashion may dictate not wearing a [[bow-tie]], and musical performers sometimes do not adhere to this. (The artists who recorded the nominees for Best Original Song quite often perform those songs live at the awards ceremony, and the fact that they are performing is often used to promote the television broadcast.)\n\nThe Academy Awards is the only awards show televised live in all United States time zones (excluding Hawaii; they aired live in [[Alaska]] starting in 2011 for the first time since 1996), Canada, the United Kingdom, and gathers millions of viewers elsewhere throughout the world. The Oscars were first televised in 1953 by [[NBC]], which continued to broadcast the event until 1960, when [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] took over, televising the festivities (including the first color broadcast of the event in 1966) through 1970, after which NBC resumed the broadcasts. ABC once again took over broadcast duties in 1976, and has broadcast the Oscars ever since; its current contract with the Academy runs through 2028.<ref>{{cite news|url =http://www.oscars.org/news/abc-signs-expansive-new-agreement-broadcast-oscarsr-hollywoods-biggest-entertainment-ceremony|title=ABC SIGNS EXPANSIVE NEW AGREEMENT TO BROADCAST THE OSCARS®, HOLLYWOOD'S BIGGEST ENTERTAINMENT CEREMONY, THROUGH 2028|publisher=Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences\n|date= 31 August 2016|accessdate = 17 February 2017|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170202130914/https://www.oscars.org/news/abc-signs-expansive-new-agreement-broadcast-oscarsr-hollywoods-biggest-entertainment-ceremony|archivedate = 2 February 2017}}</ref> The Academy has also produced condensed versions of the ceremony for broadcast in international markets (especially those outside of the Americas) in more desirable local timeslots. The ceremony was broadcast live internationally for the first time via satellite in 1970, but only two South American countries, Chile and Brazil, purchased the rights to air the broadcast. By that time, the television rights to the Academy Awards had been sold in 50 countries. A decade later, the rights were already being sold to 60 countries, and by 1984, the TV rights to the Awards were licensed in 76 countries.\n\nThe ceremonies were moved up from late March or early April to late February or early March starting in 2004 to help disrupt and shorten the intense [[For Your Consideration (advertising)|lobbying and ad campaigns]] associated with [[Oscar season]] in the film industry. Another reason was because of the growing TV ratings success of the [[NCAA Division I Men's Basketball Tournament]], which would cut into the Academy Awards audience. The earlier date is also to the advantage of ABC, as it now usually occurs during the highly profitable and important February [[sweeps]] period. Some years, the ceremony is moved into early March in deference to the [[Winter Olympic Games|Winter Olympics]]. Another reason for the move to late February and early March is to avoid the awards ceremony occurring so close to the religious holidays of [[Passover]] and [[Easter]], which for decades had been a grievance from members and the general public. Advertising is somewhat restricted, however, as traditionally no movie studios or competitors of official Academy Award sponsors may advertise during the telecast. The Awards show holds the distinction of having won the most [[Emmy Awards|Emmys]] in history, with 47 wins and 195 nominations.<ref>{{cite news|url = http://goldderby.latimes.com/awards_goldderby/2010/07/emmys-love-for-oscars-continues-with-12-nominations.html|title = Emmys love for Oscars continues with 12 nominations\n|work=Los Angeles Times |author=Tom O'Neil|date= 12 July 2010|accessdate = 13 August 2010| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20100819172053/http://goldderby.latimes.com/awards_goldderby/2010/07/emmys-love-for-oscars-continues-with-12-nominations.html| archivedate= 19 August 2010 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref>\n\nAfter many years of being held on Mondays at 9:00&nbsp;pm [[Eastern Time Zone|Eastern]]/6:00 p.m [[Pacific Time Zone|Pacific]], in 1999 the ceremonies were moved to Sundays at 8:30&nbsp;pm Eastern/5:30&nbsp;pm Pacific.<ref>{{cite news|url = https://www.nytimes.com/1998/04/08/movies/tv-notes-moving-oscar-night.html|title = TV Notes; Moving Oscar Night|work=The New York Times |author=Bill Carter|date= 8 April 1998|accessdate = 8 March 2010|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140304185231/http://www.nytimes.com/1998/04/08/movies/tv-notes-moving-oscar-night.html|archivedate=2014-03-04}}</ref> The reasons given for the move were that more viewers would tune in on Sundays, that Los Angeles rush-hour traffic jams could be avoided, and an earlier start time would allow viewers on the East Coast to go to bed earlier.<ref>[https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1955&dat=19980701&id=-CsiAAAAIBAJ&sjid=eqYFAAAAIBAJ&pg=6637,43314 Academy Awards will move to Sunday night] Reading Eagle – 1 July 1998; From ''Google News Archive''</ref> For many years the film industry opposed a Sunday broadcast because it would cut into the weekend box office.<ref>[https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1980&dat=19990319&id=sKEiAAAAIBAJ&sjid=laoFAAAAIBAJ&pg=1224,4570799 Never Say Never: Academy Awards move to Sunday] The Item – 19 March 1999.

The Oscars have been infamously known for selecting specific genres of movies to be awarded. This has led to the coining of the term '[[Oscar bait]]', describing such movies. This has led at times to more specific criticisms that the Academy is disconnected from the audience, e.g., by favoring 'Oscar bait' over audience favorites, or favoring historical melodramas over critically acclaimed movies that depict current life issues.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.nypost.com/p/entertainment/movies/have_the_oscars_jumped_the_shark_LLhBrvPY35EnSH0iQzrqRJ |title=Have the Oscars jumped the shark? |accessdate=24 January 2012 | work=New York Post |first=Kyle |last=Smith|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120418115808/http://www.nypost.com/p/entertainment/movies/have_the_oscars_jumped_the_shark_LLhBrvPY35EnSH0iQzrqRJ |archivedate=2012-04-18}}</ref>\n\n===Allegations of a lack of diversity===\nThe Academy Awards have long received criticism over its lack of diversity among the nominees.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/movies/la-et-mn-hollywood-diversity-disabled-20160610-snap-story.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2017-04-25 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170426062804/http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/movies/la-et-mn-hollywood-diversity-disabled-20160610-snap-story.html |archivedate=26 April 2017 }}</ref><ref>diversityhttps://www.theguardian.com/society/2017/feb/24/oscars-diversity-debate-must-include-learning-disability</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://abcnews.go.com/Entertainment/oscars-2016-lack-diversity-historically-problem/story?id=37062502 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2017-04-25 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170426150745/http://abcnews.go.com/Entertainment/oscars-2016-lack-diversity-historically-problem/story?id=37062502 |archivedate=26 April 2017 }}</ref> The [[88th Academy Awards|88th awards ceremony]] became the target of a boycott, based on critics' perception that its all-white acting nominee list reflected bias.

The clause of the Pact of Umar which prohibited non-Muslims from building new places of worship was historically imposed on some communities of the Ottoman Empire and ignored in other cases, at the discretion of local authorities.

From 1839 to the declaration of a constitution in 1876, the Ottoman government instituted the [[Tanzimat]], a series of reforms designed to improve the status of minorities. Nevertheless, most of the reforms were never implemented because the empire's Muslim population rejected the principle of equality for Christians. By the late 1870s, the [[Greeks]], along with several other Christian nations in the [[Balkans]], frustrated with their conditions, had, often with the help of the [[Entente powers]], broken free of Ottoman rule. The Armenians remained, by and large, passive during these years, earning them the title of ''millet-i sadika'' or the \"loyal millet\".<ref name=\"Dadrian\">{{cite book |authorlink=Vahakn Dadrian |last=Dadrian |first=Vahakn N |title=The History of the Armenian Genocide: Ethnic Conflict from the Balkans to Anatolia to the Caucasus |place=Oxford |publisher=Berghahn Books |year=1995 | isbn=1-57181-666-6}}</ref>{{rp|192}}<ref>{{cite book|last1=Suny|first1=Ronald Grigor|title=Looking toward Ararat Armenia in modern history|date=1993|publisher=Indiana university press|location=Bloomington|isbn=0253207738|page=101|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=fsEeXBmL1vcC}}</ref>\n\nIn the mid-1860s and early 1870s this passivity gave way to new currents of thinking in Armenian society. Led by intellectuals educated at European universities or American missionary schools in Turkey, Armenians began to question their second-class status and press for better treatment from their government. In one such instance, after amassing the signatures of peasants from Western Armenia, the Armenian Communal Council petitioned the Ottoman government to redress their principal grievances: \"the looting and murder in Armenian towns by [Muslim] [[Kurds]] and [[Circassians]], improprieties during tax collection, criminal behavior by government officials and the refusal to accept Christians as witnesses in trial\". The Ottoman government considered these grievances and promised to punish those responsible, but no meaningful steps to do so were ever taken.<ref name=\"Akçam\" />{{rp |36}}\n\nFollowing the violent suppression of Christians during the [[Great Eastern Crisis]], particularly in [[Herzegovina uprising (1875–77)|Bosnia and Herzegovina]], [[April Uprising|Bulgaria]] and [[Serbian–Ottoman War (1876–1878)|Serbia]], the [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|United Kingdom]] and [[France]] invoked the 1856 [[Treaty of Paris (1856)|Treaty of Paris]] by claiming that it gave them the right to intervene and protect the Ottoman Empire's Christian minorities.<ref name=\"Akçam\" />{{rp |35ff}} Under growing pressure, the government of [[Ottoman Sultan|Sultan]] [[Abdul Hamid II]] declared itself a constitutional monarchy with a parliament (which was almost immediately [[Legislative session#Common procedure|prorogued]]) and entered into negotiations with the powers. At the same time, the Armenian patriarch of Constantinople, Nerses II, forwarded Armenian complaints of widespread \"forced land seizure&nbsp;... forced conversion of women and children, arson, [[Protection racket|protection extortion]], rape, and murder\" to the Powers.<ref name=\"Akçam\" />{{rp |37}}\n\nThe Russo-Turkish War of 1877–78 ended with Russia's decisive victory and its army in occupation of large parts of eastern Turkey, but not before entire Armenian districts had been devastated by massacres carried out with the connivance of Ottoman authorities. In the wake of these events, Patriarch Nerses and his emissaries made repeated approaches to Russian leaders to urge the inclusion of a clause granting local self-government to the Armenians in the forthcoming [[Treaty of San Stefano]], which was signed on 3 March 1878. The Russians were receptive and drew up the clause, but the Ottomans flatly rejected it during negotiations. In its place, the two sides agreed on a clause making the [[Sublime Porte]]'s implementation of reforms in the Armenian provinces a condition of Russia's withdrawal, thus designating Russia the guarantor of the reforms.<ref>{{citation |title=[[Treaty of San Stefano]] |quote=As the evacuation of the Russian troops of the territory they occupy in Armenia&nbsp;... might give rise to conflicts and complications detrimental to the maintenance of good relations between the two countries, the [[Sublime Porte]] engaged to carry into effect, without further delay, the improvements and reforms demanded by local requirements in the provinces inhabited by Armenians and to guarantee their security from Kurds and [[Circassians]]. |chapter=Article 16}}</ref> The clause entered the treaty as Article 16 and marked the first appearance of what came to be known in European diplomacy as the ''[[Armenian Question]]''.\n\nOn receiving a copy of the treaty, Britain promptly objected to it and particularly Article 16, which it saw as ceding too much influence to Russia. It immediately pushed for a congress of the [[great powers]] to be convened to discuss and revise the treaty, leading to the [[Congress of Berlin]] in June–July 1878. {{#tag:ref|The great powers at the Congress of Berlin were Russia, Great Britain, France, Austria-Hungary, Italy and Germany<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=EhqpAgAAQBAJ&pg=PA12#v=onepage&q&f=false|title=Iran-Turkey Relations, 1979-2011: Conceptualising the Dynamics of Politics, Religion and Security in Middle-Power States|last=Elik|first=Suleyman|date=2013|page=12|publisher=Routledge|isbn=9781136630880|language=en}}</ref>|group=\"note\"}} Patriarch Nerses sent a delegation led by his distinguished predecessor, Archbishop [[Khrimian Hayrik]], to speak for the Armenians, but it was not admitted into the sessions on the grounds that it did not represent a country. Confined to the periphery, the delegation did its best to contact the representatives of the powers and argue the case for Armenian administrative autonomy within the Ottoman Empire, but to little effect.\n\nFollowing an understanding reached with Ottoman representatives, Britain drew up an emasculated version of Article 16 to replace the original, a clause that retained the call for reforms, but omitted any reference to the Russian occupation, thereby dispensing with the principal guarantee of their implementation. Despite an ambiguous reference to Great Power supervision, the clause failed to offset the removal of the Russian guarantee with any tangible equivalent, thus leaving the timing and fate of the reforms to the discretion of the [[Sublime Porte]].<ref name=\"Akçam\" />{{rp|38–39}} The clause was readily adopted as Article 61 of the [[Treaty of Berlin (1878)|Treaty of Berlin]] on the last day of the Congress, 13 July 1878, to the deep disappointment of the Armenian delegation.\n\n=== Armenian national liberation movement ===\n{{Main|Armenian national liberation movement}}\nProspects for reforms faded rapidly following the signing of the Berlin treaty, as security conditions in the Armenian provinces went from bad to worse and abuses proliferated.

Many in the empire saw their defeat as \"Allah's divine punishment for a society that did not know how to pull itself together\".<ref name = \"Akçam\" />{{rp |84}} The Turkish nationalist movement in the country gradually came to view [[Anatolia]] as their last refuge. The Armenian population formed a significant minority in this region.\n\nAn important consequence of the [[Balkan Wars]] was also the mass expulsion of Muslims (known as ''[[muhacir]]s'') from the Balkans. Beginning in the mid-19th century, hundreds of thousands of Muslims, including [[Turkish people|Turks]], [[Circassians]], and [[Chechens]], were forcibly expelled and others voluntarily migrated from the [[Caucasus]] and the Balkans ([[Rumelia]]) as a result of the Russo-Turkish wars, the [[Circassian genocide]] and the conflicts in the Balkans. Muslim society in the empire was incensed by this flood of refugees. A journal published in Constantinople expressed the mood of the times: \"Let this be a warning&nbsp;... O Muslims, don't get comfortable! Do not let your blood cool before taking revenge\".<ref name = \"Akçam\" />{{rp |86}} As many as 850,000 of these refugees were settled in areas where the Armenians resided. The ''muhacirs'' resented the status of their relatively well-off neighbors and, as historian [[Taner Akçam]] and others have noted, some of them came to play a pivotal role in the killings of the Armenians and the [[Confiscated Armenian properties in Turkey|confiscation of their properties]] during the genocide.<ref name = \"Akçam\" />{{rp |86–87}}\n\n== World War I ==\n{{See also|Middle Eastern theatre of World War I}}\nOn 2 November 1914, the Ottoman Empire opened the Middle Eastern theater of World War I by entering hostilities on the side of the [[Central Powers]] and against the [[Allies of World War I|Allies]].

Before entering the war, the [[Imperial Government (Ottoman Empire)|Ottoman government]] had sent representatives to the [[Armenian congress at Erzurum]] to persuade Ottoman Armenians to facilitate its conquest of [[Transcaucasia]] by inciting an insurrection of Russian Armenians against the Russian army in the event a [[Caucasus Campaign|Caucasus front]] was opened.<ref name = \"Akçam\" />{{rp |136}}<ref>{{Cite book | last1 = Walker | first1 = Christopher J | authorlink = Christopher J.

Germany had brokered a deal with the [[Sublime Porte]] to commission the building of a railroad called the [[Baghdad Railway]] that would stretch from Berlin to the Middle East. At the beginning of 1915, Germany's diplomatic mission was led by Ambassador [[Hans Freiherr von Wangenheim]] who, upon his death in 1915, was succeeded by Count [[Paul Wolff Metternich]]. Like Morgenthau, von Wangenheim began receiving many disturbing messages from consular officials around the Ottoman Empire that detailed the massacres of Armenians. From the province of [[Adana]], Consul Eugene Buge reported that the CUP chief had sworn to massacre any Armenians who had survived the deportation marches.<ref name=\"Balakian\" />{{rp |186}} In June 1915, von Wangenheim sent a cable to Berlin reporting that Talaat had admitted that the deportations were not \"being carried out because of 'military considerations alone'\". One month later, he came to the conclusion that there \"no longer was doubt that the Porte was trying to exterminate the Armenian race in the Turkish Empire\".<ref name=\"Fromkin\" />{{rp |213}}\n\nWhen Wolff-Metternich succeeded von Wangenheim, he continued to dispatch similar cables: \"The Committee [CUP] demands the extirpation of the last remnants of the Armenians and the government must yield&nbsp;...

He sent fifteen reports regarding \"deportations and mass killings\" to the German chancellery.

This was to give justification for the deportation of Armenians, which is still argued by genocide deniers to this day.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Ambrosio|first1=Thomas|title=Ethnic identity groups and U.S. foreign policy|date=2002|publisher=Praeger|location=Westport (Conn.)|isbn=0275975320|pages=155–6|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0bsHGrl9p4sC}}</ref> Richter stated the deportations were intentionally meant to cover up the slaughter of Armenians:\n\n<blockquote>I have conducted a series of conversations with competent and influential Turkish personages, and these are my impressions: A large segment of the Ittihadist [Young Turk] party maintains the viewpoint that the Turkish empire should be based only on the principle of Islam and Pan-Turkism. Its non-Muslim and non-Turkish inhabitants should either be forcibly islamized, or otherwise they ought to be destroyed. These gentlemen believe that the time is propitious for the realization of this plan. The first item on this agenda concerns the liquidation of the Armenians. Ittihad will dangle before the Allies a specter of an alleged revolution prepared by the Armenian Dashnak party. Moreover, local incidents of social unrest and acts of Armenian self-defense will deliberately be provoked and inflated and will be used as pretexts to effect the deportations. Once en route, however, the convoys will be attacked and exterminated by Kurdish and Turkish brigands, and in part by gendarmes, who will be instigated for that purpose by Ittihad.<ref>{{cite book|last=Charney|first=Israel|title=The Widening Circle of Genocide|publisher=W.

I also know that both Armenians and Turks cannot live together in this country. One of these races has got to go. And I don't blame the Turks for what they are doing to the Armenians.

Whenever possible complete restitution or restoration to the previous condition should be granted. Where it is not possible, relevant compensation may be substituted as a remedy.

The revolution led to the establishment of a [[Parliament]] and approval of the first constitution. Although the constitutional revolution was successful in weakening the autocracy of the [[Qajar dynasty|Qajar]] regime, it failed to provide a powerful alternative government. Consequently, within the decades following the establishment of the new parliament, a number of critical events took place. Many of these events can be viewed as a continuation of the struggle between the constitutionalists and the Shahs of Persia, many of whom were backed by foreign powers against the parliament.\n\n=== Reza Shah ===\n       {{Main article|Rezā Shāh}}\nInsecurity and chaos created after the Constitutional Revolution led to the rise of General Reza Khan, the commander of the elite Persian Cossack Brigade who seized power in a coup d'état in February 1921. He established a constitutional monarchy, deposing the last of the Qajar shah in 1925 and introduced many social, economic, and political reforms during his reign. A number of these reforms led to public discontent which provides circumstances for an Iranian revolution.\nMohammad Reza Shah Pahlavi's father, [[Reza Shah]], replaced [[fiqh|Islamic laws]] with Western ones, which forbade traditional Islamic clothing, [[Sex segregation and Islam|separation of the sexes]] and veiling of women's faces with the [[niqab]].<ref>[[#Mackey|Mackey]], p. 184</ref> Police forcibly removed and tore [[chador]]s off women who resisted his ban on the public hijab.

However, he would avoid entering into political issues, as did other religious leaders who followed him. Hence, no widespread anti-government attempts were organized by clergy during the Reza Shah Rule. However, the future Ayatollah [[Khomeini]] was a student of Sheikh Abdul Karim Ha’eri.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Rajaee|first1=Farhang|title=Islamism and Modernism: The Changing Discourse in Iran|date=2010|publisher=University of Texas Press|isbn=9780292774360}}</ref>\n\n=== Mosaddegh and The Anglo Iranian Oil Company (today BP) ===\n{{Main article|Mohammad Mosaddegh}}{{Main article|Anglo-Persian Oil Company}}\nFrom 1901 on, the Anglo-Persian Oil Company (renamed the Anglo-Iranian oil company in 1931) - a British oil company - enjoyed the monopoly on sale and production of Iranian oil. It was the most profitable British business in the world. Most Iranians lived in poverty while the wealth generated from Iranian oil played a decisive role in maintaining Britain at the top of the world. In 1951 Iranian Prime Minister Mohammad Mosaddegh pledged to throw the company out of Iran, reclaim the petroleum reserves and free Iran from foreign powers.\n\nMosaddegh nationalized the Anglo-Iranian oil company and became a national hero. The British, however, were outraged and accused him of stealing. The British demanded punishment by the World Court and the United Nations, sent warships to the Persian Gulf and finally imposed a crushing embargo.\n\nMosaddegh was unmoved by Britain's campaign against him. One European newspaper, the [[Frankfurter Neue Presse]], reported that Mosaddegh \"would rather be fried in Persian oil than make the slightest concession for the British\". The British considered an armed invasion, but U.S. President [[Harry S. Truman]] refused his support. U.K. Prime Minister [[Winston Churchill]] decided for a coup. Mosaddegh, however, learned of their plans and ordered the British embassy shuttered in October 1952. All British diplomats and agents had to leave the country.\n\nThe British asked Truman for help; Truman, however, sympathized with nationalist movements like Mosaddegh's and had nothing but contempt for old-style imperialists like those who ran Anglo-Iranian. However, [[Dwight D. Eisenhower]]'s election as U.S. President in November 1952 changed the U.S.'s stance toward the conflict. On 20 January 1953, U.S. Secretary of State [[John Foster Dulles]] and his brother, director of the C.I.A. [[Allen Dulles]], told their British counterparts that they were ready to move against Mosaddegh. In their eyes, any country not decisively allied with the United States was a potential enemy. Iran had immense oil wealth, a long border with the Soviet Union and a nationalist Prime Minister. A fall into communism and a \"second China\" terrified the Dulles brothers.

Mohammad Reza Shah's reform program was built especially to weaken those classes that supported the traditional system. It consisted of several  elements including: the land reform; sales of some state-owned factories to finance the land reform; the enfranchisement of women; nationalization of forests and pastures; formation of a literacy corps; and institution of profit sharing schemes for workers in industry.<ref>{{Cite book|author=Amir Arjomand, Said|title=The Turban for the Crown: The Islamic Revolution in Iran |location=|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=1988|pages=72–73|isbn=9780195042580}}</ref>\n\nThe Shah advertised the White Revolution as a step towards westernization<ref>{{cite news|title=Iran: The White Revolution|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,842491,00.html|work=Time Magazine|accessdate=10 March 2011|date=11 February 1966|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110201232009/http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,842491,00.html|archivedate=1 February 2011|df=dmy-all}}</ref> and was a way for him to legitimize the Pahlavi dynasty. Part of the reason for launching the White Revolution was that the Shah hoped to get rid of the landlords' influence and create a new base of support among the peasants and working class.<ref>{{Cite book|author=Siavoshi, Sussan|title=Liberal Nationalism in Iran: The failure of a movement|location=Boulder, Colorado|publisher=Westview Press|year=1990|page=23|isbn=978-0-8133-7413-0}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book|author=Bayar, Assef|chapter=Historiography, class, and Iranian workers|editor=Lockman, Zachary|year=1994|title=Workers and Working Classes in the Middle East: Struggles, Histories, Historiographies|publisher=State University of New York Press|location=Albany, New York|page=[https://books.google.com/books?id=BFzOVmj1iCIC&pg=PA198 198]|isbn=978-0-7914-1665-5}}</ref>\n\nThus the White Revolution in Iran represented a new attempt to introduce reform from above and preserve traditional power patterns. Through land reform, the essence of the White Revolution, the Shah hoped to ally himself with the peasantry in the countryside, and hoped to sever their ties with the aristocracy in the city. What the Shah did not expect was that the White Revolution led to new social tensions that helped create many of the problems the Shah had been trying to avoid. The Shah's reforms more than quadrupled the combined size of the two classes that had posed the most challenges to his monarchy in the past – the intelligentsia and the urban working class. Their resentment towards the Shah also grew since they were now stripped of organizations that had represented them in the past, such as political parties, professional associations, trade unions, and independent newspapers. The land reform, instead of allying the peasants with the government, produced large numbers of independent farmers and landless laborers who became loose political cannons, with no feeling of loyalty to the Shah. Many of the masses felt resentment towards the increasingly corrupt government; their loyalty to the clergy, who were seen as more concerned with the fate of the populace, remained consistent or increased. As Ervand Abrahamian pointed out, ''The White Revolution had been designed to preempt a Red Revolution. Instead, it paved the way for an Islamic Revolution.''<ref>{{harvnb|Abrahamian|2008|pages=139–40}}</ref> The White Revolution's economic \"[[Trickle-down economics|trickle-down]]\" strategy also did not work as intended. In theory, oil money funneled to the elite was supposed to be used to create jobs and factories, eventually distributing the money, but instead the wealth tended to get stuck at the top and concentrated in the hands of the very few.<ref>{{harvnb|Abrahamian|2008|page=140}}</ref>\n\n=== Rise of Ayatollah Khomeini ===\n[[File:عکسی از خمینی.JPG|thumbnail|Khomeini]]\n{{Main article|Ruhollah Khomeini}}\n{{See also|Movement of 15 Khordad}}\n{{multiple image\n<!-- Layout parameters -->\n | align             = <!-- right (default), left, center, none --> \n | direction         = vertical \n | background color  = <!-- box background -->\n | width             = <!-- displayed width of each image in pixels (an integer, omit \"px\" suffix); overrides \"width[n]\"s below -->\n | caption_align     = <!-- left (default), center, right --> \n\n<!-- Header -->\n | header_background = \n | header_align      = <!-- center (default), left, right -->\n | header            = \n\n<!--image 1-->\n | image1            = 15khordad1.jpg\n | width1            = 200\n | alt1              = \n | link1             = \n | thumbtime1        =\n | caption1          =  People of Tehran in the [[Movement of 15 Khordad|demonstrations of 5 June 1963]] with pictures of Ruhollah Khomeini in their hands.\n<!--image 2-->\n | image2            =Khordad222.jpg\n | width2            = 200\n | alt2              = \n | link2             = \n | thumbtime2        =\n | caption2          = Protesters carrying the body of one of the victims\n<!-- and so on, to a maximum of 10 images (image10) -->\n}}\nThe post-revolutionary leader – Shia cleric [[Ayatollah]] Ruhollah Khomeini – first came to political prominence in 1963 when he led opposition to the Shah and his [[White Revolution]].

Khomeini left Iraq, instead moving to a house bought by Iranian exiles in [[Neauphle-le-Château]], a village near [[Paris]], [[France]]. The Shah hoped that Khomeini would be cut off from the mosques of Najaf and be cut off from the protest movement. Instead, the plan backfired badly.

There the two signed an agreement for a draft constitution that would be \"Islamic and democratic\". It signaled the now official alliance between the clergy and the secular opposition.<ref name=\"Milani Shah\" /><ref name=\"Axworthy\" /> In order to help create a democratic facade, Khomeini placed Westernized figures (such as Sadegh Qotbzadeh and Ebrahim Yazdi) as the public spokesmen of the opposition, and never spoke to the media of his intentions to create a theocracy.<ref name=\"Milani Shah\" />\n\n==== Continued conflict ====\nStreet demonstrations continued at full force with little response from the military; by late October, government officials effectively even ceded the [[University of Tehran]] to student protesters.<ref name=\"Kraft-New Yorker\" /><ref name=\"Harney\">[[#Harney|Harney]]</ref> Worse, the opposition was increasingly becoming armed with weapons, firing at soldiers and attacking banks and government buildings in an attempt to destabilize the country.<ref name=\"Amuzegar\" /><ref name=\"Pahlavi 2004\" />\n\nOn 5 November, demonstrations at University of Tehran became deadly after a fight broke out with armed soldiers.<ref name=\"Abrahamian\" /><ref name=\"Kurzman\" /><ref name=\"Kraft-New Yorker\" /><ref name=\"Harney\" /> Within hours, Tehran broke out into a full-scale riot.

Secular and leftist politicians piled onto the movement hoping to gain power in the aftermath, ignoring the fact that Khomeini was the very antithesis to all of the positions they supported.<ref name=\"Milani Shah\" /> While it was increasingly clear to more secular Iranians that Khomeini was not a liberal, he was widely perceived as a figurehead, and that power would eventually be handed to the secular groups.<ref name=\"Milani Shah\" /><ref name=\"Harney\" />\n\n==== Demoralization of the Army ====\nThe military leadership was increasingly paralyzed by indecision, and rank-and-file soldiers were demoralized, having been forced to confront demonstrators while prohibited from using their own weapons (and being condemned by the Shah if they did).<ref name=\"Eisenstadt\" /> Increasingly, Khomeini called on the soldiers of the armed forces to defect to the opposition.<ref name=\"Pahlavi 2004\" /><ref name=\"Abrahamian 1982\" /> Revolutionaries gave flowers and civilian clothes to deserters, while threatening retribution to those who stayed.

The telegram effectively declared his belief that the Shah would not survive the protests, and that the US should consider withdrawing its support for his government and persuading the monarch to abdicate. The United States would then help assemble a coalition of pro-Western military officers, middle class professionals, and moderate clergy, with Khomeini installed as a Gandhi-like spiritual leader.<ref name=\"Little\">{{cite book|last=Little|first=Douglas|title=American Orientalism: The United States and the Middle East since 1945|url=https://books.google.com/?id=jb3ai8l6jWMC&pg=PA225&lpg=PA225&dq=William+Sullivan+thinking+the+unthinkable#v=onepage&q=William%20Sullivan%20thinking%20the%20unthinkable&f=false|isbn=9780807877616|date=15 September 2009}}</ref>\n\nThe telegram touched off a vigorous debate in the American cabinet, with some (such as National Security Advisor [[Zbigniew Brzezinski]]<ref name=\"Little\" />) rejecting it outright.

On 28 December, he secured an agreement with another major National Front figure, Shahpour Bakhtiar. Bakhtiar would be appointed prime minister (a return to civilian rule), while the Shah and his family would leave the country for a \"vacation\". His royal duties would be carried out by a Regency Council, and three months after his departure a referendum would be submitted to the people deciding on whether Iran would remain a monarchy or become a republic. A former opponent of the Shah, Bakhtiar became motivated to join the government because he was increasingly aware of Khomeini's intentions to implement hard-line religious rule rather than a democracy.<ref name=\"Milani-Persians\" /> Karim Sanjabi immediately expelled Bakhtiar from the National Front, and Bakhtiar was denounced by Khomeini (who declared that acceptance of his government was the equivalent of \"obedience to false gods\").<ref name=\"Milani Shah\" /><ref name=\"Geist\">{{cite web|last=Geist|first=Dan|title='A Darker Horizon': The Assassination of Shapour Bakhtiar|url=https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/tehranbureau/2011/08/a-darker-horizon-the-assassination-of-shapour-bakhtiar.html|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160609050914/http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/tehranbureau/2011/08/a-darker-horizon-the-assassination-of-shapour-bakhtiar.html|archivedate=9 June 2016|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\n==== The Shah leaves ====\nThe Shah, hoping to see Bakhtiar established, kept delaying his departure.

To demonstrate his support, Khomeini called for demonstrators to occupy the streets throughout the country. He also sent a letter to American officials warning them to withdraw support for Bakhtiar.<ref name=\"Milani Shah\" /> Bakhtiar became increasingly isolated, with members of the government (including the entire Regency Council) defecting to Khomeini.

Scholar Guity Nashat highlights this neglected aspect of the revolution, “Although women’s participation in the events leading to the February 11 revolution was instrumental in its success, most studies have not addressed the reasons for their involvement or their contribution.”<ref>{{cite book |title=Women and revolution in Iran |last=Nashat |first=Guity |date=1983 |publisher=Westview Press |year= |isbn=0-86531-931-6 |location= |pages=1}}</ref> Janet Baur argues the necessity of examine the daily lives of women, their living conditions and their relationship to other groups in order to understand their participation in the socio-political events of the revolution. She further explains that the cultural, ideological, social and material factors shaping the social life and class differences in the period just prior to the revolution need to be studied in order to understand how the Iranian women's social consciousness developed and how it led them to take part in public protests.<ref name=\":2\" /> Caroline M. Brooks argues that women were left to express their concerns through the protest rather than in the [[Majlis of Iran|Majlis]]. Thus, this created a \"dangerous bargaining position for activist women\" since rather than arguing and their position through intellect they were only able to \"argue by numbers in the streets and be repelled by force\".<ref name=\":3\" />\n\nThere are some contesting understandings in academic literature regarding the reasons behind the mobilization of women. While some argue that the micro level actions of women can be understood through religious and political ideologies, others argue that that it is in fact the effect of manipulations of information, symbols and context which should be studied.<ref name=\":2\" />\n\n=== Casualties ===\n{{Further information|Casualties of the Iranian Revolution}}\nSome sources (such as [[Emadeddin Baghi]], a researcher at the [[Bonyad#Islamic Republic|Martyrs Foundation]]) claim 2,781 protesters and revolutionaries were killed in 1978–79 during the Revolution.<ref name=\"Baghi\"/><ref>Researcher Emad al-Din Baghi at the Martyrs Foundation (Bonyad Shahid) counted 2,781 protesters killed in 1978–79, a total of 3,164 killed between 1963 and 1979.</ref> Khomeini reported of a much larger number; he said that \"60,000 men, women and children were martyred by the Shah's regime.\"<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/><ref name=\"emadbaghi2\">[http://www.emadbaghi.com/en/archives/000592.php#more A Question of Numbers] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140804172903/http://www.emadbaghi.com/en/archives/000592.php |date=4 August 2014 }} IranianVoice.org 8 August 2003 Rouzegar-Now Cyrus Kadivar</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.iranchamber.com/government/laws/constitution.php|title=Iran Chamber Society: The Constitution of Islamic Republic of Iran|work=iranchamber.com|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100218140202/http://www.iranchamber.com/government/laws/constitution.php|archivedate=18 February 2010|df=dmy-all}}</ref>  According to at least one western source (historian [[Ervand Abrahamian]]), the number executed by revolutionary courts as the revolution was consolidated (8000 opponents between June 1981 and June 1985<ref>[[Mojahedin-e Khalq]], but also \"Fedayins and Kurds as well as Tudeh, National Front, and Shariatmadari supporters\"</ref>) exceeded those killed by the royalist government trying to stop the revolution.<ref>Abrahamian, Ervand (2008) ''History of Modern Iran'', Columbia University Press, p. 181</ref>\nWhile Iranians believed the opposition's casualty figures, post-revolution western and thus anti-revolution estimates mostly supported the defeated government's casualty figures.<ref name=\"Baghi\"/><ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/><ref name=\"Afkhami\"/><ref name=\"Kurzman\"/><ref name=Amuzegar>{{cite book|last=Amuzegar|first=Jahangir|title=Dynamics of the Iranian Revolution|url=https://books.google.com/?id=3KL5FvOejKkC&pg=PA253|page=253|isbn=9780791407318|year=1991}}</ref>\n\n=== Songs of Iranian Revolution ===\nIranian revolutionary songs are ballads epic that composed  during the Islamic Revolution in Iran in support of the revolution and opposition the Pahlavi dynasty.<ref name=\"Torab2007\">{{cite book|author=Azam Torab|title=Performing Islam: Gender and Ritual in Islam|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=XsWorLT4p3UC|year=2007|publisher=BRILL|pages=142–43|isbn=90-04-15295-4|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160805073753/https://books.google.com/books?id=XsWorLT4p3UC|archivedate=5 August 2016|df=dmy-all}}</ref> Before the victory of revolution, these chants were made by various political supporters and many of them recorded on cassette tapes in underground and home studios.

In late October 1979, the exiled and dying Shah was admitted into the United States for cancer treatment. In Iran there was an immediate outcry and both Khomeini and leftist groups demanding the Shah's return to Iran for trial and execution. On 4 November 1979 youthful Islamists, calling themselves [[Muslim Student Followers of the Imam's Line]], invaded the embassy compound and [[Iran hostage crisis|seized its staff]]. Revolutionaries were angry because of how the Shah had fled abroad while the Embassy-based American CIA and British intelligence organized a [[1953 Iranian coup d'état|coup d'état]] to overthrow his nationalist opponent who was a legitimately elected official.\n\nThe holding of hostages was very popular and continued for months even after the death of the Shah. As Khomeini explained to his future President [[Abolhassan Banisadr|Banisadr]],{{quote|This action has many benefits. ... This has united our people. Our opponents do not dare act against us. We can put the constitution to the people's vote without difficulty ...<ref>[[#Moin|Moin]], p. 228</ref>}}\n\nWith great publicity [[Muslim Student Followers of the Imam's Line|the students]] released documents from the American embassy or \"nest of spies,\" showing moderate Iranian leaders had met with U.S. officials (similar evidence of high-ranking Islamists having done so did not see the light of day).<ref>[[#Moin|Moin]], pp. 248–49</ref> Among the casualties of the hostage crisis was Prime Minister Bazargan and his government who resigned in November unable to enforce the government's order to release the hostages.<ref>[[#Keddie|Keddie]], p. 249</ref>\n\nThe prestige of Khomeini and the hostage taking was further enhanced with the failure of a hostage rescue attempt, widely credited to divine intervention.<ref>Bowden, Mark, ''Guests of the Ayatollah'', Atlantic Monthly Press, 2006, p. 487</ref>\n\nIt ended with the signing of the [[Algiers Accords]] in Algeria on 19 January 1981. The hostages were formally released into United States custody the following day, just minutes after the new American president [[Ronald Reagan]] was sworn in. The hostages had been held at the U.S. embassy in Tehran for 444 days.\n\n==== Suppression of opposition ====\n{{see also|Nojeh coup plot}}\nIn early March Khomeini announced, \"do not use this term, ‘democratic.’ That is the Western style,\" giving pro-democracy liberals (and later leftists) a taste of disappointments to come.<ref>[[#Bakhash|Bakhash]], p. 73.</ref>\n\nIn succession the [[National Democratic Front (Iran)|National Democratic Front]] was banned in August 1979, the provisional government was disempowered in November, the [[Muslim People's Republican Party]] banned in January 1980, the [[People's Mujahedin of Iran]] guerrillas came under attack in February 1980, a purge of universities was begun in March 1980, and leftist Islamist [[Abolhassan Banisadr]] was impeached in June 1981.{{citation needed|date=February 2017}}\n\nAfter the revolution, human rights groups estimated the number of casualties suffered by protesters and prisoners of the new system to be several thousand.

Brief trials lacking defense attorneys, juries, transparency or opportunity for the accused to defend themselves,<ref>[[#Bakhash|Bakhash]], p. 61.</ref> were held by revolutionary judges such as [[Sadegh Khalkhali]], the ''[[Sharia]]'' judge.

Khomeini attacked the MEK as ''[[Munafiq|monafeqin]] ''(hypocrites) and ''[[kafir|kafer]]'' (unbelievers).<ref>[[#Moin|Moin]], pp. 234, 239</ref>  ''Hezbollahi'' people attacked meeting places, bookstores, newsstands of Mujahideen and other leftists<ref>[[#Bakhash|Bakhash]], p. 123.</ref> driving them underground.

An attempt by Khomeini to forge a reconciliation between Banisadr and IRP leaders had failed<ref>[[#Bakhash|Bakhash]], p. 153</ref> and now it was Banisadr who was the rallying point \"for all doubters and dissidents\" of the theocracy, including the MEK.<ref>[[#Moin|Moin]], p. 238</ref>\n\nWhen leaders of the [[National Front (Iran)|National Front]] called for a demonstration in June 1981 in favor of Banisadr, Khomeini threatened its leaders with the death penalty for apostasy \"if they did not repent.\"<ref>[[#Schirazi|Schirazi]], p. 127.</ref>  Leaders of the [[Freedom Movement of Iran]] were compelled to make and publicly broadcast apologies for supporting the Front's appeal.<ref>[[#Schirazi|Schirazi]], p. 127</ref> Those attending the rally were menaced by Hezbollahi and Revolutionary Guards and intimidated into silence.<ref>[[#Bakhash|Bakhash]], pp. 158–59</ref>\n\nThe MEK retaliated with a campaign of terror against the IRP. On 28 June 1981, a bombing of the office of the IRP killed around 70 high-ranking officials, cabinet members and members of parliament, including [[Mohammad Beheshti]], the secretary-general of the party and head of the Islamic Republic's judicial system. The government responded with thousands of arrests and hundreds of executions.<ref>[[#Moin|Moin]], pp. 241–42.</ref> Despite these and other assassinations<ref name=autogenerated3 /> the hoped-for mass uprising and armed struggle against the Khomeiniists was crushed.\n\nThe MEK bombings were not the only violent opposition to the Khomeinist rule.

It was with one of these countries that the [[Iran–Iraq War]], which killed hundreds of thousands and dominated life in the Islamic Republic for the next eight years, was fought.

The attempt was a reaction to the secular political discourse namely Marxism, liberalism and nationalism. However we could observe the great influence of western culture in Iran after coup d’etat in 1953. Following the death of Ayatollah Boroujerdi, some of the scholars like Murtaza Mutahhari, Muhammad Beheshti and Muhmud Talighani found new opportunity to change conditions. Before them, Boroujerdi was considered as a conservative Marja. They tried to reform conditions after the death of the ayatollah. They presented their arguments by rendering lectures in 1960 and 1963 in Tehran. The result of the lectures was the book \"An inquiry into principles of Mar’jaiyat\". Some of the major issues highlighted were the government in Islam, the need for the clergy's independent financial organization, Islam as a way of life, advising and guiding youth and necessity of being community. Allameh Tabatabei refers to velayat as a political philosophy for Shia and velayat faqih for Shia community. There are also other attempts to formulate a new attitude of Islam such as the publication of three volumes of Maktab Tashayyo.  Also somebodies believe that it is indispensable to revive the religious gathered in Hoseyniyeh-e-Ershad.<ref>{{cite book|authors=Samih Farsoun, MehrdadMashayekhi|url=https://books.google.com/books/about/Iran.html?id=S1RsZrwm2p4C|title=Iran: Political Culture in the Islamic Republic|isbn=9780203993514|date=7 January 1993}}</ref>\n\n== Gallery ==\n<gallery>\nFile:زخمی انقلابی.JPG|An injured revolutionary during protests against Pahlavi regime.\nFile:اعتراض مردم انقلابی.JPG|Protests in summer 1978.\nFile:شهیدان انقلابی.JPG|Revolutionary victims.\nFile:هفده شهریور.JPG|Black Friday.\nFile:Iranian Revolution Women.jpg|Women protesting during Iranian Revolution in 1979.\nFile:Ali Khamenei in Iranian Revolution protests.jpg|Current Iranian leader, [[Ali Khamenei]] in a Revolutionary protest in [[Mashhad]].\nFile:Shapour Bakhtiar Cabinet.jpg|Shah visiting Bakhtiar cabinet before his exit from Iran.\nFile:1978 Iranian revolution - row of men holding khomeini's photos.jpg|Row of men holding Khomeini's photos.\nFile:Shah's exit from Iran 04.jpg|People celebrating Shah's exit from the country.\nFile:Statue of Shah Revolution.jpg|Removal of Shah's statue by the people in [[University of Tehran]].\nFile:خمینی در مهرآباد.JPG|Khomeini at [[Mehrabad Airport]].\nFile:خمینی میان مردم.JPG|People accompanying Khomeini from Mehrabad to [[Behesht Zahra]].\nFile:خمینی در بهشت زهرا.JPG|Khomeini in Behesht Zahra.\n|People protesting beside [[Shahyad Tower]] (now [[Azadi Tower]]).\nFile:ExecutionGenerals150279.jpg|Executed Generals of Imperial Army: Reza Naji, [[Mehdi Rahimi]], and [[Manuchehr Khosrowdad]]\nFile:Imam Khomeini and Taleghani (2).jpg|Khomeini before a speech at Alavi school.\n</gallery>\n\n== See also ==\n{{Portal|Islam|Iran|Military history|Politics|1970s}}\nRevolution-related topics:\n* [[Background and causes of the Iranian Revolution]]\n* [[Civil resistance]]\n* [[History of Iran]]\n* [[Ruhollah Khomeini]]\n* [[History of the Islamic Republic of Iran]]\n* [[1979 energy crisis]]\n* [[History of political Islam in Iran]]\n* [[Iran hostage crisis]]\n* [[Organizations of the Iranian Revolution]]\n* [[Guadeloupe conference]]\n* [[Fajr decade]]\nRelated conflicts:\n* [[Persian Constitutional Revolution]]\n* [[1953 Iranian coup d'état]]\n* [[White Revolution]]\n* [[Iran–Iraq war]]\n* [[Kurdish Rebellion of 1983]]\n* [[List of modern conflicts in the Middle East]]\nGeneral:\n* [[Human rights in Islamic Republic of Iran]]\n* [[People's Mujahedin of Iran]]\n* [[Persecution of Bahá'ís]]\n* [[International rankings of Iran]]\n* [[Leftist guerrilla groups of Iran]]\n* [[Island of Stability (speech)]]\n\n==References==\n===Notes===\n{{reflist|group=Note}}\n\n===Citations===\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n=== Bibliography ===\n{{refbegin}}\n* {{Cite book |ref=Arjomand|author=Arjomand, Said Amir |title=Turban for the Crown: The Islamic Revolution in Iran |publisher=Oxford University Press|year=1988 |isbn=0-19-504257-3}}\n* {{Cite book |ref=Abrahamian1982|author=Abrahamian, Ervand |title=Iran between two revolutions|publisher=Princeton University Press|year=1982 |isbn=0-691-00790-X}}\n* {{Cite book |ref=Bakhash|author=Bakhash, Shaul |title=Reign of the Ayatollahs'' |publisher=Basic Books, |year=1984 |isbn=0-465-06888-X }}\n* {{Cite book |ref=Graham|author=Graham, Robert|title=Iran, the Illusion of Power |publisher=St. Martin's Press |year=1980 |isbn=0-312-43588-6}}\n* {{Cite book |ref=Harney|author=Harney, Desmond|title=The priest and the king: an eyewitness account of the Islamic revolution\n|publisher=I.B.

The names were not used immediately and Kit Kat first appeared in the 1920s, when Rowntree's launched a brand of boxed chocolates entitled Kit Cat. This continued into the 1930s, when Rowntree's shifted focus and production onto its [[Black Magic (chocolates)|Black Magic]] and Dairy Box brands. With the promotion of alternative products the Kit Cat brand decreased and was eventually discontinued.<ref name=\"Kk1\">{{cite web|url=http://www.nestle.com/MediaCenter/NewsandFeatures/AllNewsFeatures/Happy-75th-birthday-KitKat.htm |title=Happy 75th birthday Kit Kat] Nestlé |accessdate=10 October 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101015224428/http://www.nestle.com/MediaCenter/NewsandFeatures/AllNewsFeatures/Happy-75th-birthday-KitKat.htm |archivedate=15 October 2010 }}</ref> The original four-finger bar was developed after a worker at Rowntree's York Factory put a suggestion in a recommendation box for a snack that \"a man could take to work in his pack\".<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.yorkpress.co.uk/news/8446094.KitKat___s_75th_anniversary_heralded/|title=KitKat's 75th anniversary heralded|newspaper=[[The Press]]|location=[[Christchurch]], [[New Zealand]]|publisher=[[Fairfax Media]]|date=12 October 2010|accessdate=4 May 2013}}</ref> The bar launched on 29 August 1935, under the title of Rowntree's Chocolate Crisp (priced at [[Old penny sterling|2d]]), and was sold in London and throughout Southern England.<ref name=\"professional\">{{cite web|title=The History of Kit Kat|url=http://www.nestleprofessional.com/uk/en/SiteArticles/Pages/History_of_KitKat.aspx|publisher=[[Nestlé]]|accessdate=4 May 2013}}</ref>\n\nThe product's official title of Rowntree's Chocolate Crisp was renamed Kit Kat Chocolate Crisp in 1937, the same year that Kit Kat began to incorporate \"Break\" into its recognisable advertising strategy.<ref name=\"Kk1\"/> The colour scheme and first flavour variation to the brand came in 1942, owing to [[World War II]], when food shortages prompted an alteration in the recipe. The flavour of Kit Kat was changed to \ndark chocolate; the packaging abandoned its Chocolate Crisp title, and was adorned in blue.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://popsop.com/39282 |title=Kit Kat Turns 75 |publisher=Popsop |location=[[Stevenage]], England |date=11 October 2010 |accessdate=4 May 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130620212415/http://popsop.com/39282 |archivedate=20 June 2013 }}</ref> After the war the title was altered to Kit Kat and resumed its original milk recipe and red packaging.\n\n[[File:KitKat.jpg|thumb|4-finger US Kit Kat|left]]\nFollowing on from its success in the United Kingdom, in the 1940s Kit Kat was exported to Canada, South Africa, Ireland, Australia, and New Zealand. In 1958, Donald Gilles, the executive at JWT Orland, created the iconic advertising line \"Have a Break, Have a Kit Kat\". The brand further expanded in the 1970s when Rowntree created a new distribution factory in Germany to meet European demand, and established agreements to distribute the brand in the USA and Japan through the Hershey and [[Fujiya Co.|Fujiya]] companies, respectively.<ref name=\"Kk1\"/> \n\nIn June 1988, Swiss company Nestlé acquired Kit Kat through the purchase of Rowntree's.

Nestlé, which has a substantial presence in the US, had to honour the licensing agreement when it bought Rowntree in 1988 which allowed Hershey to retain the Kit Kat licence so long as Hershey was not sold. As Kit Kat is one of Hershey's top five brands in the US market, the Kit Kat licence was a key factor in Hershey's failed attempt to attract a serious buyer in 2002.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.confectionerynews.com/Markets/Nestle-quiet-on-Hershey-sale|title=Nestlé quiet on Hershey sale|work=Confectionery News|publisher=[[William Reed Business Media]]|date=5 August 2002|accessdate=5 May 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|last=Sorkin|first=Andrew Ross|agency=[[New York Times]]|url=http://www.sfgate.com/default/article/Possible-buyers-seller-far-apart-on-Hershey-sale-2778035.php|title=Possible buyers, seller far apart on Hershey sale / Price and politics are obstacles|newspaper=[[San Francisco Chronicle]]|publisher=[[Hearst Corporation|Hearst Communications]]|location=San Francisco|date=27 August 2002|accessdate=4 May 2013}}</ref>\n\nVariants in the traditional chocolate bar first appeared in 1996 when Kit Kat Orange, the first flavour variant, was introduced in the United Kingdom. Its success was followed by several varieties including mint and caramel, and in 1999 Kit Kat Chunky was launched and received favourably by international consumers. Variations on the traditional Kit Kat have continued to develop throughout the 2000s. In 2000, Nestlé acquired Fujiya's share of the brand in Japan, and also expanded its marketplace in Japan, Russia, Turkey, and Venezuela, in addition to markets in Eastern and Central Europe.<ref name=\"Kk1\"/> Throughout the decade Kit Kat has introduced dozens of flavours and line extensions within specific consumer markets, and celebrated its 75th anniversary on 10 October 2009.{{Citation needed|date=October 2017}}\n\nThe traditional bar has four fingers which each measure approximately {{convert|1|cm|in|1}} by {{convert|9|cm|in|1}}.

Kit Kat bars contain varying numbers of fingers depending on the market, ranging from the half-finger sized Kit Kat Petit in Japan, to the three-fingered variants in Arabia, to the twelve-finger family-size bars in Australia and France. Kit Kat bars are sold individually and in bags, boxes and multi-packs.

Kit Kat bars in the United States are produced under licence by The Hershey Company, a Nestlé competitor, due to a prior licensing agreement with Rowntree.\nThe year 2003 was a turning point for the Kit Kat bar as well as the confectionery industry in general. The popularity of [[low carb]] diets and the push to healthier eating stifled sales growth in many parts of the world. In addition, fierce competition from [[Cadbury]]'s newly formed [[Cadbury Dairy Milk|Dairy Milk]] superbrand also contributed to sales of the Kit Kat decreasing considerably in its home market of the UK, and threatened to depose it from its No.1 position.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/business/3560857.stm|title=Fat profits: Choc tactics|work=[[BBC News]]|date=24 March 2004|accessdate=4 May 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/health/3315183.stm|title=Consumers 'snub unhealthy brands'|work=[[BBC News]]|publisher=[[BBC|British Broadcasting Corporation]]|location=London|date=13 December 2003|accessdate=4 May 2013}}</ref> The solution adopted by Nestlé and others was to increase dramatically the number of new and unique variations of their confections and market them as [[Special edition|limited or special editions]], whereby they would usually only be available for a few months at a time so as not to impact the sales of their permanent edition counterparts.<ref>{{cite news|last=Uhlig|first=Robert|url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/1454755/Cheesecake-Kit-Kat-Give-us-a-break.html|title=Cheesecake Kit Kat?

As a result of milk shortages after the end of World War II, the milk chocolate coating was suspended and a dark chocolate was used instead during that period.{{Citation needed|date=October 2017}}\n\nSince its introduction in the 1970s, the Hershey's Kit Kat packaging and advertising in the United States differed from the branding used in every other country where it was sold. In 2002, Hershey Kit Kats adopted the slanted [[ellipse]] logo used worldwide by Nestlé, though the ellipse was red and the text white. The US version of \"Kit Kat Chunky\" is known as \"Big Kat\".\n\nIn the United Kingdom, the product has traditionally been wrapped in silver foil and an outer paper band. In 2001, [[flow wrap]] plastic was substituted as the confectionery's packaging.<ref>Suzy Bashford [http://www.marketingmagazine.co.uk/article/73773/brand-health-check-kit-kat---nestle-wise-repackage-kit-kat-kit-kat-shed-its-old-style-foil-paper-covering-flow-wrap-tear-strip-convince-consumers-right-move-asks-suzy-bashford \"BRAND HEALTH CHECK: Kit kat\"], ''Marketing'', 14 June 2001</ref>\n\nIn Norway, a similar product is manufactured by [[Mondelēz International]] and sold as [[Kvikk Lunsj]]; Kvikk Lunsj XXL is similar to a Kit Kat Chunky.\n\n==Marketing and promotion==\nAfter launching in the 1930s, Rowntree's Chocolate Crisp was originally advertised as \"the biggest little meal\" and \"the best companion to a cup of tea\". During World War II, Kit Kat was depicted as a valuable wartime foodstuff, with the slogan \"what active people need\". 'Kitty the Kat' arrived in the late 1940s to emphasise the \"rich full cream milk\" qualities of the bar and, thanks to contemporary improvements in production methods, also highlighted the new and improved 'snap' by responding to a biscuit being broken off screen. The first Kit Kat poster appeared in 1951, and the first colour TV advertisement appeared in 1969.\n\nSince 1958, the slogan for the Kit Kat in the UK and elsewhere has been \"Have a break... have a Kit Kat\". However, in 1995, Nestlé sought to trademark the \"Have a break\" portion. After a ten-year legal battle, which was contested by rival Mars, the [[European Court of Justice]] ruled on 7 July 2005 to send the case back to the [[Courts of the United Kingdom|British courts]].<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2005/07/07/business/worldbusiness/07iht-nestle.html?_r=0|title= Kit Kat slogan dispute sent back to U.K. courts|newspaper=[[International Herald Tribune]]|publisher=[[The New York Times Company]]|location=[[La Défense]], France|date=8 July 2005|accessdate=5 May 2013}}</ref> In 2004, Nestlé UK used the slogan \"Make the most of your break\",<ref>{{cite web|last=Marinovich|first=Slaven|url=http://www.brandchannel.com/features_profile.asp?pr_id=235|title=Kit Kat barred|work=Brand Channel|publisher=[[Interbrand]]|date=6 June 2005|accessdate=5 May 2013|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131203013655/http://www.brandchannel.com/features_profile.asp?pr_id=235|archivedate=3 December 2013|df=dmy-all}}</ref> but later returned to the original slogan.\n\nThe United States also used the short-lived slogan, \"Tastes So Good, You'll Roar\", in the early 1980s. The TV commercial most known from this slogan involves a young man biting into one of the Kit Kat bars in a grocery store, and roaring like a lion so loudly the whole store shakes violently, knocking items from the shelves. Another short-lived US slogan was \"That's What You Want\", whose television adverts showed people pulling unlikely foodstuffs from their pockets or purses, before rejecting them in favour of a Kit Kat.\n\nThe \"classic\" [[United States|American]] version of the \"Gimme a Break\" Kit Kat [[jingle]] (in use in the [[US]] since 1986) was written by [[Ken Shuldman]] (copy) and [[Michael A. Levine]] (music) for the [[DDB Worldwide|DDB Advertising Agency]]. Versions of the original have been covered by [[Carrie Underwood]], [[Shawn Colvin]], and many studio singers, as well as people who have appeared on-camera in the commercials. The jingle was cited in a study by [[University of Cincinnati]] researcher James J. Kellaris as one of the top ten \"[[earworm]]s\" – bits of melody that become stuck in your head. Another version of the advertising jingle 'Gimme a break' created for Kit Kat \"Factory\" commercial in the US was an original recording by [[Andrew W.K.]] W.K. was hired to write a new musical version for their \"Gimme a break\" slogan.

However, the \"classic\" song has also been used again since the newer version first aired in 2004.\n\nA 1989 United Kingdom advertisement for Kit Kat, in which a zoo photographer \"takes a break\" from waiting for pandas to appear in an enclosure and misses them performing a dance routine, came in 30th in [[Channel 4]]'s \"100 Greatest Adverts\" poll in 2000.\n\nThe Maltese tour boat [[HMS Greetham (M2632)|MV ''Lady Davinia'']] had a distinctive red and white Kit Kat paint scheme before she sank in 2008.\n\nIn late 2004 through to the end of 2006, Nestlé Rowntree sponsored the English football club [[York City F.C.]].

The distance was changed in 1896 to its current {{convert|1+1/4|mi|km|abbr=off}}. On May 17, 1875, in front of an estimated crowd of 10,000 people, a field of 15 three-year-old horses contested the first Derby. Under jockey [[Oliver Lewis]], a colt named [[Aristides (horse)|Aristides]], who was trained by future [[National Museum of Racing and Hall of Fame|Hall of Famer]] [[Ansel Williamson]], won the inaugural Derby. Later that year, Lewis rode Aristides to a second-place finish in the [[Belmont Stakes]].\n\nAlthough the first race meeting proved a success, the track ran into financial difficulties and in 1894 the New Louisville Jockey Club was incorporated with new capitalization and improved facilities. Despite this, the business foundered until 1902 when [[Matt Winn|Col. Matt Winn]] of Louisville put together a syndicate of businessmen to acquire the facility. Under Winn, Churchill Downs prospered and the Kentucky Derby then became the preeminent stakes race for three-year-old thoroughbred horses in North America.\n\nDerby participants are limited to three-year-old horses. [[Apollo (horse)|Apollo]] (1882) is the only horse to have won the Derby without having raced at age two.<ref>{{cite web|last=Martin|first=Kevin|title=Longshot Apollo wins the Kentucky Derby, 1882|url=http://colinsghost.org/2012/04/longshot-apollo-wins-the-kentucky-derby-1882.html|publisher=Colin's Ghost|accessdate=February 22, 2014}}</ref>\n\nThoroughbred owners began sending their successful Derby horses to compete a few weeks later in the [[Preakness Stakes]] at the [[Pimlico Race Course]], in [[Baltimore|Baltimore, Maryland]], followed by the [[Belmont Stakes]] in [[Elmont, New York]]. The three races offered the largest purse and in 1919 [[Sir Barton]] became the first horse to win all three races. However, the term [[Triple Crown of Thoroughbred Racing|Triple Crown]] didn't come into use for another eleven years. In 1930, when [[Gallant Fox]] became the second horse to win all three races, sportswriter Charles Hatton brought the phrase into American usage. Fueled by the media, public interest in the possibility of a \"superhorse\" that could win the Triple Crown began in the weeks leading up to the derby. Two years after the term was coined, the race, which had been run in mid-May since inception, was changed to the first Saturday in May to allow for a specific schedule for the Triple Crown races. Since 1931, the order of Triple Crown races has been the Kentucky Derby first, followed by the Preakness Stakes and then the Belmont Stakes. Prior to 1931, eleven times the Preakness was run before the Derby. On May 12, 1917 and again on May 13, 1922, the Preakness and the Derby were run on the same day. On eleven occasions the Belmont Stakes was run before the Preakness Stakes.\n[[File:Churchill Downs 1901.jpg|thumb|right|300px|[[Churchill Downs]] in 1901]]\nOn May 16, 1925, the first live radio broadcast of the Kentucky Derby was originated by [[WHAS (AM)|WHAS]] and was also carried by [[WGN (AM)|WGN]] in Chicago.<ref>\"Derby To Go On The Air\", ''The New York Times'', May 16, 1925, p. 11</ref> On May 7, 1949, the first television coverage of the Kentucky Derby took place, produced by [[WAVE (TV)|WAVE-TV]], the NBC affiliate in Louisville.

In 1968 [[Dancer's Image]] became the first (and to this day the only) horse to win the race and then be disqualified after traces of [[phenylbutazone]], an analgesic and [[Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug|anti-inflammatory drug]], were found in the horse's [[urinalysis]]; [[Forward Pass (horse)|Forward Pass]] won after a protracted legal battle by the owners of [[Dancer's Image]] (which they lost).  [[Forward Pass (horse)|Forward Pass]] thus became the Eighth winner for [[Calumet Farm]]. Unexpectedly, the regulations at Kentucky thoroughbred race tracks were changed some years later, allowing horses to run on [[phenylbutazone]]. In 1970, [[Diane Crump]] became the first female jockey to ride in the Derby, finishing 15th aboard Fathom.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://edition.cnn.com/2012/09/26/sport/diane-crump-first-female-jockey/index.html|title=Jockey who refused to stay in the kitchen - CNN|last=CNN|first=By Sheena McKenzie,|work=CNN|access-date=2018-02-02}}</ref>\n\nThe fastest time ever run in the Derby  was set in 1973 at 1:59.4 minutes when [[Secretariat (horse)|Secretariat]] broke the record set by [[Northern Dancer]] in 1964. Not only has Secretariat's [[World record|record time]] yet to be topped, in the race itself, he did something unique in Triple Crown races: each successive quarter, his times were faster. Though times for non-winners were not recorded, in 1973 Sham finished second, two and a half lengths behind Secretariat in the same race. Using the thoroughbred racing convention of one length equaling one-fifth of a second to calculate [[Sham (horse)|Sham]]'s time, he also finished in under two minutes. Another sub-two-minute finish, only the third, was set in 2001 by [[Monarchos]] at 1:59.97.<ref>{{cite book|last=Dandrea|first=Phil|title=Sham: Great Was Second Best|year=2010|publisher=Acanthus Publishing|url=http://www.ShamHorse.com}}</ref>\n\nThe 2004 Derby marked the first time that jockeys, as a result of a [[court order]], were allowed to wear corporate advertising logos on their clothing.\n\nIn 2005, the [[purse distribution]] for the Derby was changed, so that horses finishing fifth would henceforth receive a share of the purse; previously only the first four finishers did so.\n\nNorman Adams has been the designer of the Kentucky Derby Logo since 2002. On February 1, 2006, the Louisville-based [[fast food|fast-food]] company [[Yum! Brands, Inc.]] announced a corporate sponsorship deal to call the race \"The Kentucky Derby presented by Yum!

The [[mint julep]], an iced drink consisting of [[bourbon whiskey|bourbon]], [[mentha|mint]], and a [[sugar]] syrup, is the traditional beverage of the race. The historic drink can be served in an ice-frosted silver julep cup, but most Churchill Downs patrons sip theirs from souvenir glasses (first offered in 1939 and available in revised form each year since) printed with all previous Derby winners.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Sneed|first1=Tierney|title=The Origin of Your Favorite Kentucky Derby Traditions|url=https://www.usnews.com/news/articles/2013/05/03/the-origin-of-your-favorite-kentucky-derby-traditions|website=usnews.com|accessdate=3 July 2016}}</ref> Also, [[burgoo]], a thick stew of beef, chicken, pork, and vegetables, is a popular Kentucky dish served at the Derby.\n[[File:Louisville Clock.jpg|thumb|right|250px|[[Louisville Clock]] (often called the Louisville Derby Clock)]]\n\nThe infield, a spectator area inside the track, offers general admission prices but little chance of seeing much of the race. Instead, revelers show up in the infield to party with abandon. By contrast, \"Millionaire's Row\" refers to the expensive box seats that attract the rich, the famous and the well-connected. Women appear in fine outfits lavishly accessorized with large, elaborate hats. As the horses are paraded before the grandstands, the [[University of Louisville]] [[The University of Louisville Marching Band|Marching Band]] plays [[Stephen Foster]]'s \"[[My Old Kentucky Home]],\" a tradition which began in 1921.<ref>{{cite web|title=My Old Kentucky Home|url=http://www.kentuckyderby.com/experience/traditions/song-my-old-kentucky-home}}</ref> The event attracts spectators from a large area, flying in hundreds of private aircraft to [[Louisville International Airport]].<ref name=ain2015-05-05>{{cite news |first=Curt |last=Epstein |url=http://www.ainonline.com/aviation-news/business-aviation/2015-05-05/derby-boxing-match-fuel-atlantics-best-day-ever |title=Derby, Boxing Match Fuel Atlantic's Best Day Ever |work=Aviation International News |date=5 May 2015 |accessdate=6 May 2015 }}</ref>\n\nThe Derby is frequently referred to as \"''The Run for the Roses'',\" because a lush blanket of 554 red [[rose]]s is awarded to the Kentucky Derby winner each year. The tradition originated in 1883 when [[New York City|New York]] socialite E. Berry Wall presented roses to ladies at a post-Derby party that was attended by Churchill Downs founder and president, Col. M. Lewis Clark. This gesture is believed to have led Clark to the idea of making the rose the race's official flower. However, it was not until 1896 that any recorded account referred to roses being draped on the Derby winner. The [[Governor of Kentucky]] awards the garland and the [[Kentucky Derby Trophy]]. Pop vocalist [[Dan Fogelberg]] composed the song \"[[Run for the Roses (song)|Run for the Roses]]\" which was released in time for the 1980 running of the race.<ref>{{cite web|title=Dan Fogelberg Prodigy Chat transcript Treehouse.org|url=http://www.treehouse.org/fogelberg/intview7.html|accessdate=October 16, 2014}}</ref>\n\n==Records==\n'''Most wins by a [[jockey]]'''\n* 5 – [[Eddie Arcaro]] (1938, 1941, 1945, 1948, 1952)\n* 5 – [[Bill Hartack]] (1957, 1960, 1962, 1964, 1969)\n\n'''Most wins by a [[Horse trainer|trainer]]'''\n* 6 – [[Ben A.

The brutality of this race can be readily understood by comparing the list of teams who set off from the start line against the roster of cars that survive for the full duration.  Of the 60 cars which qualified for the 2017 race, only 49 cars ran the full duration successfully.<ref>https://www.motorsport.com/wec/results/2017/le-mans-24-hours-162895/</ref>\n\nSince 2012, the 24 Hours of Le Mans has been a part of the [[FIA World Endurance Championship]]. In 2017, it will be the third round of the season.\n\nOver the years, Le Mans influenced events have sprung up all around the globe, popularizing the 24-hour format at places like [[24 Hours of Daytona|Daytona]], [[24 Hours Nürburgring|Nürburgring]], [[Spa 24 Hours|Spa-Francorchamps]], and [[Bathurst 24 Hour|Bathurst]]. The [[American Le Mans Series]] and Europe's [[Le Mans Series]] of multi-event sports car championships were spun off from 24 Hours of Le Mans regulations. Other races include the [[Le Mans Classic]], a race for historic Le Mans race cars from years' past held on the Circuit de la Sarthe, a [[24 Hours of Le Mans (motorcycle race)|motorcycle version of the race]] which is held on the shortened Bugatti version of the same circuit, a kart race (24 Heures Karting), a truck race (24 Heures Camions), and a parody race [[24 Hours of LeMons]].\n\nThe '''[[2017 24 Hours of Le Mans]]''' ({{lang-fr|link=no|85<sup>e</sup> 24 Heures du Mans}}) was held on June 17–18 at the [[Circuit de la Sarthe]], [[Le Mans]], [[France]]. [[Porsche in motorsport|Porsche]] claimed their 19th overall victory with drivers [[Timo Bernhard]], [[Brendon Hartley]], and [[Earl Bamber]] piloting the [[Porsche 919 Hybrid]].\n\n==Purpose==\nAt a time when [[Grand Prix motor racing]] was the dominant form of motorsport throughout Europe, Le Mans was designed to present a different test. Instead of focusing on the ability of a car company to build the fastest machines, the 24 Hours of Le Mans would instead concentrate on the ability of manufacturers to build sporty yet reliable cars. This encouraged innovation in producing reliable and [[Fuel economy in automobiles|fuel-efficient vehicles]], because [[Endurance racing (motorsport)|endurance racing]] requires cars that last and spend as little time in the pits as possible.\n\nAt the same time, the layout of the track necessitated cars with better aerodynamics and stability at high speeds. While this was shared with Grand Prix racing, few tracks in Europe had straights of a length comparable to the [[Mulsanne Straight|Mulsanne]]. Additionally, because the road is public and thus not as meticulously maintained as permanent racing circuits, racing puts more strain on the parts, increasing the importance of reliability.\n\nThe [[1973 oil crisis|oil crisis]] in the early 1970s led organizers to adopt a fuel economy formula known as [[Group C]] that limited the amount of fuel each car was allowed. Although it was later abandoned, fuel economy remains important as new fuel sources reduced time spent during pit stops. Such technological innovations have had a trickle-down effect and can be incorporated into consumer cars. This has also led to faster and more exotic [[supercar]]s as manufacturers seek to develop faster road cars in order to develop them into even faster GT cars.\n\nAdditionally, in recent years hybrid systems (flywheel, super-capacitor, battery coupled with both gasoline and diesel) have been championed in the LMP category as rules have been changed to their benefit and to further push efficiency.\n\n==The race==\nThe race is held in June, leading at times to very hot conditions for drivers, particularly in closed vehicles with poor ventilation; rain is commonly seen. The race begins in mid-afternoon and finishes the following day at the same hour the race started the previous day.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.lemans.org/en/races/24h/handy-information/schedule-week.html | title=Schedule | publisher=lemans.org | accessdate=22 April 2011 | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110807100830/http://www.lemans.org/en/races/24h/handy-information/schedule-week.html | archivedate=7 August 2011 | df=dmy-all }}</ref> Over the 24 hours, modern competitors often cover distances well over {{convert|5000|km|mi|sigfig=3|abbr=on}}.

It also tests endurance, with drivers frequently racing for over two hours before a relief driver can take over during a pit stop while they eat and rest. Current regulations mandate that three drivers share each competing vehicle.\n\nCompeting teams race in groups called \"classes\", or cars of similar specification, while also competing simultaneously for outright placing amongst all classes. Originally, the race showcased cars as they were sold to the general public, then called \"Sports Cars\", in contrast with the specialized [[race car|racing cars]] used in [[Grand Prix motor racing]]. Over time, the competing vehicles evolved away from their publicly available road car roots, and today the race is made of two overall classes: prototypes, and Grand Touring cars (similar to sports cars sold to the public).  These are further broken down into 2 sub-classes each,  constructors' prototypes, privateer prototypes and 2 subclasses of GT cars.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.lemans.org/en/races/24h/discover-endurance/introduction.html | title=Two major car families | publisher=lemans.org | accessdate=22 April 2011 | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110807090320/http://www.lemans.org/en/races/24h/discover-endurance/introduction.html | archivedate=7 August 2011 | df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n\nCompeting teams have had a wide variety of organization, ranging from competition departments of road car manufacturers (eager to prove the supremacy of their products) to professional motor racing teams (representing their commercial backers, some of which are also car manufacturers who want to win without paying for their own teams) to amateur teams (racing as much to compete in the famous race as to claim victory for their commercial partners).\n\nThe race has also spent long periods as a round of the [[World Sportscar Championship]], although Le Mans has always had a stronger reputation than the World Championship, and is a round of the [[FIA World Endurance Championship]]. The race is also known as a leg of the informal [[Triple Crown of Motorsport]] which links [[Formula One]], [[IndyCar]], and [[sports car racing]] to represent a career achievement for drivers. Additionally, it is seen as a leg of the [[Triple Crown (endurance racing)|Triple Crown of endurance racing]], which links the three largest sports car races together, with [[12 Hours of Sebring]] and [[24 Hours of Daytona]] forming the other legs.  Since 1998, the American Le Mans Series holds a second endurance race along with the 12 hours of Sebring every year called \"[[Petit Le Mans]]\", as a 10-hour American version. In 2014, the [[United SportsCar Championship|Tudor Sports Car Championship]] (a merger of the races at Sebring; [[Petit Le Mans]] in [[Braselton]], Georgia; the [[6 Hours of Watkins Glen]] in [[Watkins Glen, New York|Watkins Glen]], New York; and the [[Rolex Sports Car Series]]' [[24 Hours of Daytona]]) held all four major American endurance classics in preparation for teams to race at [[Le Mans]].\n\n===Cars===\n[[File:Andy Prialux Dirk Muller Joey Hand BMW Motorsport LMGTE Pro BMW M3 Le Mans 2011.jpg|thumb|A [[BMW M3]] GT2 at the 24 Hours of Le Mans]]\nThe race has approximately 60 competitors. Each car was required to have at least two seats, but recently cars only need the ability to accommodate a second seat in the cockpit rather than the seat itself. No more than two doors are allowed; open cockpit cars do not require doors. Since 2014, all cars in the premier LMP1 category must have a roof due to safety concerns, with open-cockpit cars only permitted in the slightly slower LMP2 category. Since 2017, all prototype cars, LMP1 or LMP2, must have closed cockpits.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://auto-racing.speedtv.com/article/le-mans-inside-the-2014-lmp1-regulations/ |title=LE MANS: Inside The 2014 LMP1 Regulations |publisher=Auto-racing.speedtv.com |date=2012-11-27 |accessdate=2013-08-05 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130710021103/http://auto-racing.speedtv.com/article/le-mans-inside-the-2014-lmp1-regulations |archivedate=10 July 2013 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n\nAlthough all cars compete at the same time, there are separate classes. A prize is awarded to the winner of each class, and to the overall winner. The number of classes has varied over the years, but there are now four. Custom-built [[Le Mans Prototype]]s (LMP) are the top two classes, LMP1 and LMP2, divided by speed, weight, and power output. From 2011, the next two classes are production-based [[grand tourer]] (GT) classes, GT Endurance Pro and GT Endurance AM. Both of these classes utilize the [[LM GTE]], or \"Le Mans Grand Touring Endurance\" regulations. Although the top class is the most likely to be the overall winner, lower classes have won on occasion due to better reliability.\n\n===Drivers===\nOriginally, there were no rules on the number of drivers of a car, or how long they could drive. Although almost all teams used two drivers in the early decades, some Le Mans drivers such as [[Pierre Levegh]] and [[E.R. Hall|Eddie Hall]] attempted to run the race solo, hoping to save time by not having to change drivers. This practice was later banned. Until the 1980s, there were teams in which only two drivers competed, but by the end of the decade, the rules were changed to stipulate that at least three drivers must drive each car.\n\nBy the 1990s, due to the speeds of the cars and the strain it puts on drivers, additional rules to reduce driver fatigue mandated that drivers could not drive for over 240 minutes over a 6-hour period, and that no one driver could run for over 14 hours total. With careful management of driver stints, this makes it possible to complete the race with only two drivers (as [[Jeroen Bleekemolen]] and Cooper MacNeil did in 2014), although the vast majority of teams still continue to use three drivers.<ref>http://www.24h-lemans.com/en/race/historical_2_2_2501.html?recherche=1&annee=2014&nbparpage=9#topContent</ref><ref>http://www.racer.com/wec-le-mans/item/104435-lm24-iron-man-rotation-for-macneil-and-bleekemolen</ref>\n\n===Traditions and unique rules===\nAlthough it has been a part of the [[World Sportscar Championship]] for most of its existence, the race has had different regulations for safety and competition reasons partly due to its length. For many decades, cars were required to run at least an hour into the race before they were allowed to refill fluids for the car, such as oil or coolant, with the exception of fuel. This was an attempt by the ACO to help increase efficiency and reliability. Cars which could not last the first hour without having to replace lost fluids were disqualified.\n\nAnother rule unique to Le Mans is that cars must be switched off while they are refuelled in the pits. Not only is this safer and less of a fire hazard, but it is also another test of reliability, as cars with the ability to restart many times under race conditions are harder. Another element of this rule is that mechanics are not allowed to work on the car while it is being refuelled (other than helping a driver in or out of the car), which has led teams to adapt innovative ways in which to decrease the time of these lengthy pit stops. Drivers are allowed to get out of the car and be replaced by another driver during refuelling. Those rules are also in application in the [[FIA World Endurance Championship]].\n\nThere are various long-standing traditions at Le Mans, including the waving of the [[Flag of France|French tricolor]] to start the race. This is usually followed by a fly-over featuring jets trailing blue, white and red smoke. A similar flag tradition is the waving of safety flags during the final lap of the race by track marshals, congratulating the winners and other finishers.{{citation needed|date=May 2014}}\n\nLe Mans was the venue for the first televised instance of a winning driver celebrating by spraying champagne instead of drinking it.<ref name=\"Miscellany pg 82\">G.

The race has been cancelled ten times—in 1936 (a labour strike during the [[Great Depression]]) and between 1940 and 1948 (World War II).\n\nThe race usually takes place on the second weekend of June, with qualifying and practice taking place on the Wednesday and Thursday before the race, following a car inspection on Monday and Tuesday. Currently, these sessions are held in the evening, with two separate two-hour sessions held each night. Friday serves as a day of rest and a parade of all the drivers through [[Le Mans]] is held.\n\nTest days  held at the end of April or beginning of May served as a pre-qualification weeding out the slowest cars. However, in 2005 the exorbitant cost of transporting cars to and from Le Mans led organizers to move the test day to the first weekend of June. In fact pre-qualification was eliminated in 2000, meaning that all competitors invited to the test would be allowed into the race.\n\nSince 2001 the [[Le Mans Legend]] races have also been part of the schedule, usually running exhibition races during qualifying days, a few hours prior to the sessions for the Le Mans entrants.\n\nUntil 2008, the race started at 16:00 on Saturday (though in 1968, the race started at 14:00 due to the lateness of the race on the calendar. In 1984 and 2007, the start time was moved ahead to 15:00 due to the conflicting [[French presidential election, 2007|election]]). In 2006, the ACO scheduled a 17:00 start time on Saturday, 17 June in order to maximize television coverage in between the [[2006 FIFA World Cup|World Cup]] games. Since 2009, when the race took place from 13–14 June, it starts at 15:00 local time (13:00 GMT).\n\n[[Image:Le Mans 2008 Rolling start.jpg|thumb|right|Rolling start of the {{24hLM|2008}} race]]\n\n====Classification====\nOriginally, the car that covered the greatest distance from its starting position was the winner. This is known to have caught out the [[Ford Motor Company|Ford]] team in {{24hLM|1966}}. With a dominant 1–2 lead, the two cars slowed to allow for a [[photo opportunity]] at the finish line, with [[Ken Miles]] slightly ahead of [[Bruce McLaren]]. However, since McLaren's car had actually started much farther back on the grid than Miles's, McLaren's car had actually covered the greatest distance over the 24 hours. With the margin of victory determined to be eight metres, McLaren and his co-driver, [[Chris Amon]], were declared the winners. The decision cost Miles and [[Denny Hulme]] a victory. Miles had already won the other two endurance races at Sebring and Daytona. With a win at Le Mans, he would have become not only the first man to win all three, but the first to win them all in the same year.\n\nThe \"greatest distance\" rule was modified with the introduction of a rolling start in 1971, and now the car that completes the greatest distance as of the completion of the final lap – where \"greatest distance\" is measured by the start/finish line for all competitors – wins. When two cars finish the same number of laps, their finishing order is determined by the faster overall completion time. This rule was used in the [[2011 24 Hours of Le Mans]] to determine the race winner, when the top two finishers both completed 355 laps, with only 13 seconds difference between them.<ref>{{Citation|last=Fredstar88|title=Final Lap of 24 Hours of Le Mans 2011|date=2011-06-12|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UCs8Nvt65uU|accessdate=2016-07-02}}</ref>\n\nAlthough \"greatest distance run\" determines the provisional order of finishers, additional requirements must be met for a car to be classified.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.fiawec.com/presentation/regulation.html|title=Regulation {{!}} FIA World Endurance Championship|website=www.fiawec.com|access-date=2016-07-02}}</ref>\n* A car must complete the last lap of the race, and must complete the entire circuit faster than a prescribed maximum lap time.  Ambiguity in this classification requirement has led to dramatic scenes where damaged cars have waited in the pits or on the edge of the track close to the finish line, then restarted their engines and crawled across the line to be listed amongst classified finishers.{{Citation needed|date=July 2010}} The practice of intentionally \"waiting for the final lap\" in this manner has been prohibited by rule in recent years.\n* Cars must complete 70 percent of the distance covered by the overall winner to be classified. A car failing to complete this number of laps, even if it finishes the last lap of the race, is not deemed worthy of classification because of poor reliability or speed.\nAll classification requirements hold except in exceptional circumstances, as determined by the race stewards.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n====Le Mans start====\n{{Further|Standing start}}\n[[Image:Lemans Circuit Bugatti.JPG|thumb|right|The permanent pits and pit straight for both the ''[[Circuit de la Sarthe]]'' and Bugatti Circuit]]\n\nThe race traditionally began with what became known as the ''Le Mans start'', in which cars were lined up along the length of the pits. Until 1962, cars were lined up in order of engine capacity, but beginning in 1963 qualifying times determined the lineup. The starting drivers stood on the opposite side of the front stretch. When the French flag dropped to signify the start, the drivers ran across the track, entered and started their cars without assistance, and drove away. This became a safety issue in the late 1960s when some drivers ignored their safety harnesses, then a recent invention. This led to drivers running the first few laps either improperly harnessed due to attempting to do it while driving or sometimes not even harnessed at all, leading to several deaths when cars were involved in accidents due to the bunched field at the start.\n\nThis starting method inspired [[Porsche]] to locate the ignition key switch to the left of the steering wheel. In a left-hand drive car, this allowed the driver to use his left hand to start the engine, and his right hand to put the [[Transmission (mechanics)|transmission]] into gear, which in turn shaves off a few tenths of a second.\n\nAnother method for speeding up the start was developed by [[Stirling Moss]]. His car was waiting with first gear already engaged. When he jumped in, he switched the starter on without depressing the clutch. The car was immediately jerked forward by the starter motor, but the engine did not start due to low RPM. After a few seconds of motion, he then pushed the clutch down, allowing the engine to speed up and start while the car was moving.\n\nFeeling this type of start was unsafe, in the {{24hLM|1969}} race, [[Jacky Ickx]] opposed it by walking across the track while his competitors ran. Although he was nearly hit by a faster competitor's car while walking, Ickx took the time to fasten his safety belts before pulling away. Privateer [[John Woolfe]] died in an accident on the first lap of that race; Ickx won.\n\nThe traditional Le Mans start was changed for {{24hLM|1970}}. Cars were still lined up along the pit wall, but the drivers were already inside and strapped in. At the dropping of the French tricolor, the drivers started their engines and drove away. Since 1971, when that method was done away with, a [[rolling start]] (sometimes known as an ''[[Indianapolis 500|Indianapolis]] start'') begins the race.<ref name=\"24 key dates for the 24 Hours\">{{cite web|title=24 key dates for the 24 Hours|url=http://www.lemans.org/en/news/24-key-dates-for-the-24-hours_6843.html|publisher=ACO|accessdate=20 April 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120422191720/http://www.lemans.org/en/news/24-key-dates-for-the-24-hours_6843.html|archivedate=22 April 2012|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\n==The circuit==\n[[Image:Circuit de la Sarthe track map.svg|thumb|right|The [[Circuit de la Sarthe]] with the [[Bugatti Circuit]] (dashed line)]]\n{{Main|Circuit de la Sarthe}}\nThe circuit on which the 24 Hours of Le Mans is run is named the [[Circuit de la Sarthe]], after the [[Departments of France|department]] that Le Mans is within. It consists of both permanent track and public roads that are temporarily closed for the race. Since 1923, the track has been extensively modified, mostly for safety reasons, and now is {{convert|13.626|km|3|abbr=on}} in length. Although it initially entered the town of Le Mans, the track was cut short in order to better protect spectators. This led to the creation of the [[Dunlop Tyres|Dunlop]] Curve and Tertre Rouge corners before rejoining the old circuit on the [[Mulsanne]]. Another major change was on the Mulsanne itself in 1990, when the [[FIA]] decreed that it would no longer sanction any circuit that had a straight longer than {{convert|2|km|1|abbr=on}}. To comply with this, two [[chicanes]] were added to the 6 km long straight. The addition of the chicanes was further influenced by the fact that the speed of [[Welter Racing|WM P88]]-[[PNV engine|Peugeot]] French driver [[Roger Dorchy]] had been timed at {{convert|405|kph|0|abbr=on}} during the [[1988 24 Hours of Le Mans|1988]] race.\n\nDue to the shorter length of the straights, top speeds at Le Mans are now generally around {{convert|205|mph|0|abbr=on}}.\n\nThe public sections of the track differ from the permanent circuit, especially in comparison with the [[Bugatti Circuit]] which is inside the Circuit de la Sarthe. Due to heavy traffic in the area, the public roads are not as smooth or well kept. They also offer less grip because of the lack of soft-tyre rubber laid down from racing cars, though this only affects the first few laps of the race. The roads are closed only within a few hours of the practice sessions and the race, before being opened again almost as soon as the race is finished. Workers have to assemble and dismantle safety barriers every year for the public sections.\n\n==History==\n:''For a list of individual race reports, see [[:Category:24 Hours of Le Mans races]].''\n\n===1923–1939===\n[[Image:1923Lemans.JPG|thumb|A poster for the [[1923 24 Hours of Le Mans]]]]\n\nThe 24 Hours of Le Mans was first run on 26 and 27 May 1923, through public roads around Le Mans. Originally planned to be a three-year event awarded the [[Rudge-Whitworth]] Triennial Cup, with a winner being declared by the car which could go the farthest distance over three consecutive 24-hour races, this idea was abandoned in 1928 and overall winners were declared for each single year depending on who covered the farthest distance by the time 24 hours were up. The early races were dominated by French, British, and Italian drivers, teams, and cars, with [[Bugatti]], [[Bentley]], and [[Alfa Romeo]] being the top brands. Innovations in car design began appearing at the track in the late 1930s, with Bugatti and Alfa Romeo running highly aerodynamic bodywork in order to run down the [[Mulsanne Straight]] at faster speeds. The race was cancelled in 1936 due to [[Matignon Agreements (1936)|general strikes in France]], and the outbreak of [[World War II]] in 1939 resulted in a ten-year hiatus.\n\n===1949–1969===\nFollowing the reconstruction of circuit facilities, the race was resumed in 1949<ref name=\"24 key dates for the 24 Hours\" /> with renewed interest from major automobile manufacturers. 1949 was also [[Ferrari]]'s first victory, the [[Ferrari 166 S|166MM]] of [[Luigi Chinetti]] and [[Peter Mitchell-Thomson, 2nd Baron Selsdon|Peter Mitchell-Thomson]].<ref name=\"24 key dates for the 24 Hours\" /> After the formation of the [[World Sportscar Championship]] in 1953, of which Le Mans was a part, Ferrari, [[Aston Martin]], [[Mercedes-Benz]], [[Jaguar (car)|Jaguar]] and many others began sending multiple cars backed by their respective factories to compete for overall wins against their competitors. This competitiveness sometimes resulted in tragedy, as in the [[1955 Le Mans disaster]] during the {{24hLM|1955}} race in which [[Pierre Levegh]]'s car crashed into a crowd of spectators, killing more than 80&nbsp;people. The incident led to the widespread introduction of safety measures, not only at the circuit, but elsewhere in the motorsport world. Following the accident, the entire pit complex was razed and rebuilt further back allowing the pit straight to be widened, although there was still no barrier between the track and the pit lane. Safety standards improved but the cars got faster, and the move from open-cockpit roadsters to closed-cockpit coupés resulted in speeds of over {{convert|320|km/h}} on the Mulsanne. Ford entered the picture with the [[Ford GT40|GT40]], finally ending Ferrari's dominance with four straight wins (1966-1969) before the 1960s ended and the cars, and the race, changed substantially.\n\n===1970–1980===\n[[Image:Renault Alpine A443 Donington 2007.jpg|thumb|right|[[Renault Alpine A443]] from 1978]]\nFor the new decade, the race took a turn towards more extreme speeds and automotive designs. These extreme speeds led to the replacement of the typical standing ''Le Mans start'' with a rolling ''Indianapolis start''. Although production-based cars still raced, they were now in the lower classes while purpose-built sportscars became the norm. The [[Porsche 917]], [[Porsche 935|935]], and [[Porsche 936|936]] were dominant throughout the decade, but a resurgence by French manufacturers [[Equipe Matra Sports|Matra]]-[[Simca]] and [[Renault]] saw the first victories for the nation since the 1950 race. This decade is also remembered for strong performances from many privateer constructors, with two scoring the only victories for a privateer, in the decade. [[John Wyer]]'s [[Mirage (race car)|Mirage]] won in {{24hLM|1975}}, while [[Jean Rondeau]]'s self-titled chassis took {{24hLM|1980}}.\n\n===1981–1993===\n[[Image:Porsche 962 1988 Le Mans at Silverstone 2007.JPG|thumb|[[Group C]] [[Porsche 962]] from 1988]]\nThe rest of the 1980s was known for the dominance by Porsche under the new [[Group C]] race car formula that encouraged fuel efficiency. Originally running the effective [[Porsche 956|956]], it was later replaced by the [[Porsche 962|962]]. Both chassis were affordable enough for privateers to purchase them en masse, leading to the two model types winning six years in a row. Jaguar and Mercedes-Benz returned to sports car racing, with Jaguar being the first to break Porsche's dominance with victories in 1988 and 1990 (with the [[XJR-9]] and [[Jaguar XJR-12]] respectively). Mercedes-Benz won in 1989, with what was seen as the latest incarnation of the elegant \"[[Silver Arrows]]\", the [[Sauber C9]], while an influx of Japanese manufacturer interest saw prototypes from [[Nissan]] and [[Toyota]]. In 1988 too, a [[Welter Racing|W.M.]] [[Peugeot]] set up a new record speeding at 405&nbsp;km/h (252&nbsp;mph) in the ''Ligne Droite des Hunaudières'', famous for its 6&nbsp;km (3.7&nbsp;mi) long straight.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.24h-lemans.com/en/news/24-hours-of-mans-the-records-to-be-beaten_2_2_1746_11149.html | title=THE RECORDS TO BE BEATEN | publisher=24h-lemans.com | accessdate=11 June 2014 }}</ref> [[Mazda]] would be the only Japanese manufacturer to succeed, with their unique [[Wankel engine|rotary]]-powered [[Mazda 787B|787B]] winning in 1991.\n\n[[File:Peugeot905 evo1ter 1993.jpg|thumb|[[Peugeot 905]] from 1993]]\nIn 1992 and 1993, Peugeot dominated the race with its [[Peugeot 905]] as the Group C formula and [[World Sportscar Championship]] were fading in participation.\n\nThe circuit would also undergo one of its most notable changes in {{24hLM|1990}}, when the 5&nbsp;km long Mulsanne was modified<ref name=\"24 key dates for the 24 Hours\" /> to include two chicanes in order to stop speeds of more than {{Convert|400|km/h|mi/h|0|abbr=on}} from being reached. This began a trend by the ACO to attempt to slow the cars on various portions of the track; although speeds over {{Convert|320|km/h|mi/h|0|abbr=on}} are still regularly reached at various points on a lap.\n\n===1994–1999===\nFollowing the demise of the [[World Sportscar Championship]], Le Mans saw a resurgence of production-based [[grand tourer]] cars. Thanks to a loophole in the rules, Porsche succeeded in convincing the ACO that a [[Dauer 962 Le Mans]] supercar was a production car, allowing Porsche to race their [[Porsche 962]] for one final time, dominating the field. Although the ACO attempted to close the loop hole for 1995, newcomer [[McLaren Cars|McLaren]] would win the race in their supercar's first appearance thanks to the reliability of the BMW V12 powered F1 GTR, beating faster yet more trouble-prone prototypes. The trend would continue through the 1990s as more exotic supercars were built in order to skirt the ACO's rules regarding production-based race cars, leading to [[Porsche]], [[Mercedes-Benz]], [[Toyota]], [[Nissan]], [[Panoz]], and [[Lotus Cars|Lotus]] entering the GT categories. This culminated in the {{24hLM|1999}} event, in which these GT cars were faced with the [[Le Mans Prototype]]s of [[BMW]], [[Audi]], and [[Ferrari]]. BMW would survive with the victory, their first and only overall Le Mans win to date, whilst Mercedes left sportscar racing indefinitely following a series of severe aerodynamic flaws <!--\"leading to several fatal accidents\"?--> with their [[Mercedes-Benz CLR|CLR]].\n\nThis strong manufacturer influence led the ACO to lending the Le Mans name to a sports car series in the United States in 1999, known as the [[American Le Mans Series]], which ran until the end of the [[2013 American Le Mans Series season|2013]] season after which it merged with [[Grand-Am Road Racing|Grand-Am]] to form the [[United SportsCar Championship]].\n\n===2000–2005===\n[[Image:Audi R10 1.JPG|thumb|left|A [[diesel engine|diesel]]-powered [[Audi R10 TDI]]]]\nMany major automobile manufacturers withdrew from sports car racing after 1999 due to the high cost. Only Cadillac and Audi remained, and Audi easily dominated with the [[Audi R8 (race car)|R8]]. Cadillac pulled out three years later, and attempts by Panoz, [[Chrysler]], and [[MG (car)|MG]] to beat Audi all fell short. After three victories in a row, Audi provided engine, team staff, and drivers to [[Bentley]], a corporate partner, which had returned in 2001, and in 2003 the factory [[Bentley Speed 8]]s beat privateer Audis. The Chevrolet Corvette Racing Team and their C5-R won several times in the GTS class, finishing 1st & 2nd in 2001, 2002, and 2004. They finished 2nd & 3rd in 2003.\n\n===Since 2006===\nAt the end of 2005, after five overall victories for the R8, and six to its V8 turbo engine, Audi took on a new challenge by introducing a [[diesel engine]]d prototype known as the [[Audi R10 TDI|R10 TDI]]. Although not the first diesel to race, it was the first to win at Le Mans. This era saw other alternative fuel sources being used, including [[bio-ethanol]], while Peugeot decided to follow Audi's lead and also pursue a diesel entry in 2007 with their [[Peugeot 908 HDi FAP|908 HDi FAP]].\n\nIn the [[2008 24 Hours of Le Mans|2008 race]] between the [[Audi R10 TDI]] and the [[Peugeot 908 HDi FAP]], the Audi won by a margin of less than 10 minutes. For the [[2009 24 Hours of Le Mans]], Peugeot introduced a new energy-recovery system similar to the [[Kinetic energy recovery system|KERS]] used in [[Formula One]].<ref>{{cite news|title= 908 HY to close Le Mans Series in hybrid style|publisher=AutoBlog}}</ref> Aston Martin entered the [[LMP1]] category, but still raced in [[FIA GT1 World Championship|GT1]] with private teams. Audi returned with the new R15 TDI, but  Peugeot prevailed in its first overall win since 1993.\n\nThe [[2010 24 Hours of Le Mans|2010]] running reaffirmed the race as a test of endurance and reliability. In adjusting their cars and engines to adhere to the 2010 regulations, Peugeot chose overall speed while Audi chose reliability. At the end of the race, all four Peugeots had retired, three due to engine failure, while Audi finished 1-2-3.\n\nThe [[2011 24 Hours of Le Mans|2011]] and [[2012 24 Hours of Le Mans|2012]] races were marred by a series of accidents. In 2011, in the first hour, the Audi driven by Allan McNish crashed heavily, barrel rolling into a tire wall shortly after the [[Dunlop Bridge]]. At night, the defending race-winning Audi driven by [[Mike Rockenfeller]] crashed in similar fashion between the Mulsanne and Indianapolis corners. Neither driver was injured, nor were any spectators. The third Audi entry driven by [[Marcel Fässler (racing driver)|Marcel Fässler]], [[André Lotterer]], and [[Benoît Tréluyer]] won the race. The 2012 race saw two factory Toyotas replace Peugeot, which had withdrawn earlier, but one of them flipped at Mulsanne Corner. Driver [[Anthony Davidson]] suffered two broken vertebrae but was able to exit the car himself. The other Toyota retired with mechanical difficulties shortly after sunset, giving Audi another victory.\n\nIn 2011, the race became the premier round of the [[Intercontinental Le Mans Cup]], an attempt to make a world championship for endurance racing again. In [[2012 24 Hours of Le Mans|2012]], the race became the centerpiece of the [[FIA World Endurance Championship]], the successor to the ILMC. The 2012 event was the first time the race was won by a [[hybrid electric vehicle]], which was the [[Audi R18#R18 e-tron quattro|Audi R18 e-tron quattro]].\n\nAfter Audi's dominance of the event in the early 2000s, Toyota has fielded competitive cars since 2012, Porsche returned to Le Mans in 2014 with a new factory LMP1 program, and Nissan returned to run an LMP1 program in 2015. Audi withdrew from racing at the 24 Hours of Le Mans in 2016 and Nissan only after one attempt in 2015.\n\nPorsche won the race in 2015, 2016 and 2017 with its [[Hybrid electric vehicle|hybrid]] [[Porsche 919 Hybrid|919]], and remains the most successful manufacturer at Le Mans, with 19 overall victories, including a seven straight from 1981 to 1987.\n\n==Innovations==\nLe Mans has seen many innovations in [[automotive design]] to counteract the circuit's difficulties. These have either been dictated by rules or have been attempts by manufacturers to outwit the competition. Some innovations were incorporated into the common automobile.\n\n===Aerodynamics===\n[[Image:Porsche 908 Langheck am 1981-08-15.jpg|thumb|right|A [[Porsche 908|Porsche 908 ''Langheck'']]]]\nOne of the keys to Le Mans is top speed, caused by the long straights that dominate the circuit. This has meant cars have attempted to achieve the maximum speeds possible instead of relying on downforce for the turns. While early competitors' cars were street cars with their bodywork removed to reduce weight, innovators like [[Bugatti]] developed cars which saw the beginnings of aerodynamics. Nicknamed ''tanks'' due to their similarity to military tanks in World War I, these cars used simple curves to cover all the mechanical elements of the car and increase top speed. Once Le Mans returned after World War II, most manufacturers would adopt closed bodies which were streamlined for better aerodynamics. A notable example in the changes brought about by aerodynamics are the 1950 entries by [[Briggs Cunningham]]. Cunningham entered two 1950 [[Cadillac Coupe de Ville]]s, one nearly stock and the other completely rebodied in a streamlined aluminum shape developed by [[Grumman|Grumman Aircraft Engineering Corporation]] that looked so unusual that it was nicknamed \"Le Monstre\" by the French press. The smoothing of body shapes and fairing-in of various parts of the machine brought about by the continual search for reduction of [[aerodynamic drag]] led to a separation from [[Grand Prix motor racing|Grand Prix]] cars, which rarely had large bodywork.\n\nAs the years went on, bodywork became all enveloping, while at the same time lighter. The larger bodywork with spoilers were able to provide more downforce for the turns without increasing the [[Drag (physics)|drag]], allowing cars to maintain high speeds. Extended bodywork would usually concentrate on the rear of the car, usually being termed ''long tail''. The bodywork also began to cover the cockpit for less drag, although open cockpits would come and go over the years as rules varied. Aerodynamics reached its peak in 1989, before the Mulsanne Straight was modified. During the {{24hLM|1988}} race, the crew of a [[PRV engine|Peugeot]] powered [[Welter Racing|W.M.]] prototype taped over the engine openings, allowing [[Roger Dorchy]] to set a recorded speed of {{Convert|405|km/h|mph|0|abbr=on}} down the Mulsanne in a publicity stunt, although the car was almost undrivable elsewhere on the circuit and the engine was soon destroyed from a lack of cooling.{{citation needed|date=February 2015}} However, for the {{24hLM|1989}} event, the [[Sauber C9|Mercedes-Benz C9]] reached {{Convert|400|km/h|mph|0|abbr=on}} under qualifying conditions.<ref>http://www.mulsannescorner.com/maxspeed.html</ref>\n\n===Engines===\n[[Image:1929 Bentley front 34 left 2.jpg|thumb|left|An early [[supercharging|supercharged]] [[Bentley]]]]\nA wide variety of engines have competed at Le Mans, in attempts to not only achieve greater speed but also to have better [[Fuel economy in automobiles|fuel economy]], and spend less time in the pits. Engine sizes have also varied greatly, with the smallest engines being a mere 569 cc ([[Simca 5|Simca Cinq]]) and the largest upwards of 8,000 cc ([[SRT Viper]] GTS-R). [[Supercharging]] was an early innovation for increasing output, first being raced in {{24hLM|1929}}, while [[turbocharging]] would not appear until {{24hLM|1974}}.\n\nThe first car to enter without an engine run by pistons would be in {{24hLM|1963}}, when [[Rover (car)|Rover]] partnered with [[British Racing Motors]] to run a [[gas turbine]] with mixed success, repeating again in {{24hLM|1965}}. The American Howmet Corporation would attempt to run a turbine again in {{24hLM|1968}} with even less success. Although the engines offered great power, they were hot and fuel-inefficient.\n\nAnother non-piston engine that would appear would be a [[Wankel engine]], otherwise known as the rotary engine. Run entirely by [[Mazda]] since its introduction in 1970, the compact engine would also suffer from fuel economy problems like the turbine had, yet would see the success that the turbine lacked. After many years of development, Mazda finally succeeded in being the only winner of the race to not have a piston-powered engine, taking the {{24hLM|1991}} event with the [[Mazda 787B|787B]]. Rotary engines were banned by the ACO following Mazda's win.\n\nAlternative fuel sources would also play a part in more normal engine designs, with the first non-gasoline car appearing in {{24hLM|1949}}. The Delettrez Special would be powered by a [[diesel engine]], while a second diesel would appear in the form of the M.A.P. the following year. Although diesel would appear at other times over the race existence, it would not be until 2006 when a major manufacturer, Audi, would invest in diesels and finally succeed, with the [[Audi R10 TDI|R10 TDI]].\n\n[[Ethanol fuel]] appeared in 1980 in a modified [[Porsche 911]], leading to a class win. Alternative biological fuel sources returned again in {{24hLM|2004}} with Team Nasamax's DM139-[[Judd (engine)|Judd]].<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.mulsannescorner.com/nasamaxdm139.html | title = Mulsannescorner.com, \"2004 Nasamax DM139\" | accessdate = 6 August 2008| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20080915211057/http://www.mulsannescorner.com/nasamaxdm139.html| archivedate= 15 September 2008 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref> In 2008, [[biofuels]] (10% [[ethanol]] for petrol engines and [[biodiesel]] for diesel engines) were allowed.

But only electrical (i.e., batteries) energy storage was allowed, ruling out [[flywheel]]-based energy recovery.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.racecar-engineering.com/news/people/282760/le-mans-2009-2011-regulations-released.html |title=Le Mans 2009 – 2001 regulations released |date=19 November 2008 |publisher=Racecar engineering |accessdate=11 October 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081228132644/http://www.racecar-engineering.com/news/people/282760/le-mans-2009-2011-regulations-released.html |archivedate=28 December 2008 |df=dmy-all }}</ref> Cars with KERS were allowed to race in 2009 under specific classification rules. Since 2010, they were able to compete for points and the championship. In 2012 the first KERS-equipped car won; the [[Audi R18#R18 e-tron quattro|Audi R18 e-tron]] with a flywheel hybrid system by [[Williams Hybrid Power]] activated and drove the front wheels. This was only allowed in certain zones, after the car had accelerated to at least 120&nbsp;km/h, in order to cancel out the acceleration advantage that four-wheelers could gain out of corners. In the same year, Toyota also started with a hybrid car, the [[Toyota TS030 Hybrid|TS030 Hybrid]], which used KERS to power its rear wheels, meaning its usage was not restricted.\n\n===Brakes===\nWith increased speeds around the track, brakes become a key issue for teams attempting to safely bring their cars down to a slow enough speed to make the Mulsanne Corner turn. [[Disc brake]]s were first seen in 1953 when the [[Jaguar C-Type]] raced at Le Mans. In 1955 the [[Mercedes-Benz 300 SLR]] introduced the [[Air brake (aircraft)|air brake]] using a large opening hood on the rear of the car.\n\nIn the 1980s, [[anti-lock braking system]]s became standard on most [[Group C]] cars as a safety measure, making it less likely that cars lose control at high speeds. By the late 1990s, [[reinforced carbon-carbon]] brakes were adapted for better stopping power.\n\n==Successful marques and drivers==\n:''For a list of winning drivers, teams, and cars, see [[List of 24 Hours of Le Mans winners]].''\n[[Image:Tom Kristensen 2014-06-10 001.jpg|thumb|The most successful participant of all time at Le Mans, Danish driver [[Tom Kristensen (racing driver)|Tom Kristensen]], has nine wins (7 with [[Audi]]), the latest in 2013.]]\n[[File:Hall of fame Le Mans-winners 2013.JPG|thumb|Tom Kristensen in the Walk of fame [[Le Mans]]-Winners 2013]]\nOver the years, many manufacturers have managed to take the overall win, while even more have taken class wins.

Jaguar has seven wins, while [[Bentley]], [[Alfa Romeo]], and Ford all won four races in a row, with Bentley recording two additional victories in other years. [[Mazda]] has been the only Japanese car to win the race—in 1991, the only win by a [[Wankel engine|rotary]] engine—though nearly every major Japanese manufacturer has attempted it.\n\nThree drivers stand apart for their number of victories. Initially [[Jacky Ickx]] held the record at six, scoring victories between 1969 and {{24hLM|1982}}, earning him an honorary citizenship to the town of Le Mans. His frequent racing-partner, [[Derek Bell (racing driver)|Derek Bell]], trailing by a single win, with five. However, [[Denmark|Dane]] [[Tom Kristensen (racing driver)|Tom Kristensen]] has beaten this record with nine wins between {{24hLM|1997}} and 2013, including six in a row. Three-time winner [[Woolf Barnato]] ({{24hLM|1928}} to {{24hLM|1930}}) and American racing legend [[AJ Foyt|A. J. Foyt]] (1967) are the only drivers to have won every Le Mans in which they participated.\n\n[[Henri Pescarolo]] won the race four times, and holds the record for the most Le Mans appearances at 33. Japan's [[Yojiro Terada]] was active as a driver until 2008, and holds the record for the most Le Mans starts without an overall win. [[Graham Hill]] is the only driver to win the so-called ''[[Triple Crown of Motorsport]]'', winning the [[Indianapolis 500]] (1966), [[Monaco Grand Prix]] (1963, 1964, 1965, 1968, 1969), and the 24 Hours of Le Mans (1972).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.usgpindy.com/news/story.php?story_id=1417 |title=Points Race Stays Tight; Montoya Joins Elite Company With Victory |author=Dan Knutson |accessdate=3 December 2007 |date=3 June 2003 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071106023236/http://www.usgpindy.com/news/story.php?story_id=1417 |archivedate=6 November 2007 |deadurl=yes }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://intakeinfo.com/automotive/monaco-grand-prix-glitz-draws-rising-stars.html |title=Monaco Grand Prix Glitz Draws Rising Stars |author=Henri Boulanger |publisher=IntakeInfo.com |accessdate=5 December 2007 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071211040252/http://intakeinfo.com/automotive/monaco-grand-prix-glitz-draws-rising-stars.html |archivedate=11 December 2007 |deadurl=yes }}</ref>\n\n==Accidents==\n{{See also|List of 24 Hours of Le Mans fatal accidents}}\nLe Mans has seen a number of fatal accidents. The [[1955 Le Mans disaster|worst]] one was in [[1955 24 Hours of Le Mans|1955]], when more than 80 spectators and driver [[Pierre Levegh]] were killed. In the wake of the disaster, many races were cancelled, including the Grand Prix races in [[German Grand Prix|Germany]], [[Spanish Grand Prix|Spain]], and [[Swiss Grand Prix|Switzerland]] (the latter as a part of a blanket ban on motorsport round-track races that is maintained to this day).<ref>Swiss Traffic Law (German)</ref> The accident led to safety regulations in all motorsports for both driver and spectator protection.\n\nAlmost all decades in which Le Mans has been run have seen their fair share of horrific accidents, such as in [[1972 24 Hours of Le Mans|1972]] when Swede [[Joakim Bonnier]] was catapulted into a forest surrounding the circuit after hitting a privately entered Ferrari near the Indianapolis section; Bonnier was killed instantly. The 1980s was a decade where some of the race's worst-ever accidents occurred. Although there were now Armco barriers along the straight, there were still no chicanes on the Mulsanne Straight – the place where almost all of the worst accidents took place during that time. The prototypes, most of which were equipped with very powerful turbocharged engines in those days, were capable of doing 240-250+ mph (387–403&nbsp;km/h) before reaching the kink and would still be doing the same kind of speeds at the end of the 3.6 mile (6&nbsp;km straight) – and even through the kink, which was a flat-out bend for all the cars on the track. In {{24hLM|1981}}, Belgian [[Thierry Boutsen]] crashed horrifically on the Mulsanne Straight in his WM-Peugeot, killing a marshal, and in the same race Frenchman Jean-Louis Lafosse was killed also on the Mulsanne Straight when his Rondeau steered very suddenly to the right and slammed into the Armco barrier on the driver's side at extreme speeds. The [[1984 24 Hours of Le Mans|1984]] race saw British privateer John Sheldon crashing at more than 200&nbsp;mph (320&nbsp;km/h) at the Mulsanne Kink; his [[Aston Martin]] [[V8 engine|V8]] powered [[Nimrod NRA/C2B|Nimrod]] tore through the Armco barriers into the trees. The resulting explosion was so violent that the woods next to the track caught fire. Sheldon survived with severe burns, and a track marshal was killed while two others were severely injured. Sheldon's own teammate, American Drake Olson in the second Nimrod-Aston Martin who was following him down the straight, crashed heavily after running over Sheldon's bodywork; he went into severe shock but survived with minor injuries. The field was under the safety car for over an hour while the crash site was cleared and the destroyed Armco barriers were replaced.\n\nIn [[1985 24 Hours of Le Mans|1985]] a similar accident befell Briton Dudley Wood in a Porsche 962 during practice. The impact of the car against the Armco, considering Wood was doing more than 230&nbsp;mph (371&nbsp;km/h), was so hard that it cracked the engine block. Fortunately, Wood survived without injury. Also in 1985 John Nielsen flipped his Sauber-Mercedes while going over the Mulsanne hump at more than 220&nbsp;mph (355&nbsp;km/h). The car landed on its roof and was destroyed, but Nielsen escaped without injury. In {{24hLM|1986}}, [[Jo Gartner]] drove a Porsche 962C into the Mulsanne barriers and was killed instantly after the car rolled multiple times, vaulted some Armco barriers, and knocked down a telegraph pole. And in [[1987 24 Hours of Le Mans|1987]], American [[Price Cobb]] crashed a works Porsche 962C after slipping on oil during Wednesday practice. The fuel tank exploded and the car burned to the ground but Cobb escaped without injury.\n\nGartner's fatal accident remained the most recent death in the race until Allan Simonsen's crash in [[2013 24 Hours of Le Mans|2013]]. However, there was one fatality during a practice session in [[1997 24 Hours of Le Mans|1997]] ([[Sebastien Enjolras]]).<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.dailysportscar.com/?p=9717 |title=Mark Cole’s Le Mans 2013 |publisher=Dailysportscar.com |date=2013-07-15 |accessdate=2013-08-05}}</ref>\n\nIn [[1999 24 Hours of Le Mans|1999]] the [[Mercedes-Benz CLR]]s suffered from aerodynamic instability leading to airborne cars. After initially happening at the Le Mans test day, Mercedes claimed to have solved the problem, only to have it occur again at warmup. [[Mark Webber]] was the unlucky driver whose car flipped on both occasions. The final and most damaging accident occurred during the race itself when [[Peter Dumbreck]]'s CLR became airborne, flying over the safety fencing and landing in the woods several metres away. No drivers were badly hurt in any of the three accidents, but Mercedes-Benz withdrew its remaining entry and ended its entire sportscar programme.\n\nIn [[2011 24 Hours of Le Mans|2011]], two horrific accidents occurred to two of the three factory [[Audi]]s in the LMP1 class. Near the end of the first hour, the No. 3 car driven by [[Allan McNish]] collided with one of the Ferrari GT cars, resulting in McNish's car smashing into the tyre wall and being thrown into the air at the Dunlop chicanes, resulting in pieces of bodywork flying over and nearly hitting many photographers on the other side of the barrier. In the eleventh hour of the race, another accident occurred, this time to the No. 1 car driven by [[Mike Rockenfeller]], when he had contact with another Ferrari GT car. In the runup to Indianapolis corner, Rockenfeller's Audi was sent into the outside barrier at over {{convert|170|mph}}. Only the main cockpit safety cell of the car remained along with major damage being done to the barriers that needed to be repaired before the race was resumed. Audi had switched to a closed-cockpit car starting in 2011, a decision credited for the fact that neither driver was injured. The 2014 regulations required all cars to be closed-cockpit as a direct result of the 2011 accident. \n                                                                     \nIn [[2012 24 Hours of Le Mans|2012]], [[Anthony Davidson]], driving for the returning Toyota team in a [[Toyota TS030 Hybrid]], collided with a [[Ferrari 458 Italia|Ferrari 458 GT2]] of Piergiuseppe Perazzini, and became airborne before crashing into the tyre barrier of the Mulsanne Corner at high speed. The Ferrari also ended up in the barrier, flipping and coming to a halt on its roof.

This was given a limited cinema release, but is now available on DVD.\n\nThe race became the center of a major motion picture in 1971 when [[Steve McQueen]] released his simply titled ''[[Le Mans (film)|Le Mans]]'', starring McQueen as Michael Delaney, a driver in the 1970 event for the [[Gulf Oil|Gulf]] Porsche team. Likened to other motorsports films such as ''[[Grand Prix (1966 film)|Grand Prix]]'' for Formula One racing and ''[[Winning]]'' for the [[Indianapolis 500]], ''Le Mans'' is the best known film to center on sports car racing. It was filmed during the race using modified racing cars carrying cameras, as well as purchased [[Porsche 917]]s, [[Ferrari 512]]s and [[Lola T70]]s for action shots made after the race.

Again using two camera cars to tape action during the race, the French film was not as widely accepted as ''Le Mans'' had been. The 1974 TV show ''[[The Goodies (TV series)|The Goodies]]'' featured an episode entitled \"[[The Race (Goodies episode)|The Race]]\" involving a comedic trio attempting to run Le Mans.\n\nA documentary film called ''[[Truth in 24]]'' narrated by [[Jason Statham]] was about the Audi team's effort to win a fifth straight title in 2008 in which Le Mans was prominently featured.\n\nA documentary film called ''The 24 Hour War'' directed by [[Adam Carolla]] and Nate Adams, starring AJ Baime, Henry Ford III, David Hobbs and [[Mario Andretti]], is about the Ford versus Ferrari rivalry at Le Mans and is one of the most famous battles in racing history.<ref name=\"IMDb\">{{cite web|title=The 24 Hour War (2016)|url=http://www.imdb.com/title/tt4875844/r|website=IMDb.com|accessdate=12 June 2017}}</ref> \n\n<!-- The second half of the third book in Patrick O'Connor's Black Tiger series, \"The Black Tiger at Le Mans\", published in 1958, has his heroes Woody and Worm racing the Black Tiger Mark II and winning the 24 hours of Le Mans race.-->\nThe race has also been used for several video games over the years, some of which have allowed players to compete for the full 24 hours.\n\n===Coverage===\n[[Motors TV]] covered the Le Mans 24 Hours in its entirety in 2006 and 2007, including coverage of the scrutineering, qualifying, driver parade, warmup, and race.

Every hour of the 2008 race was broadcast in segments on the main channel and on [[Eurosport 2]], but in recent years, a couple of hours were missed due to scheduling clashes with other sporting events.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://tv.eurosport.co.uk/tvschedule.shtml |title=Eurosport |accessdate=11 October 2010| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20101013122840/http://tv.eurosport.co.uk/tvschedule.shtml| archivedate= 13 October 2010 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref> In addition, Eurosport provided live streaming on its website to subscribers.

These exhibition races involve classic cars that had previously run at Le Mans or are similar to ones that had. Each year, a particular era of cars may participate, with the featured era changing from year to year. Though most drivers in this event are amateurs, some noted professional drivers have appeared to race cars they had previously run, such as [[Stirling Moss]] and [[Derek Bell (racing driver)|Derek Bell]].\n\n{{Main|Le Mans Classic}}\nStarting in 2002, the \"[[Le Mans Classic]]\" has been held as a biennial event on the full {{convert|13|km|adj=on|abbr=on}} circuit in July. The races take place over a full 24-hour day/night cycle, with starts on set times allowing cars from the same era to compete at the same time. A team typically consists of a car in each class, and the team with the most points accumulated over five or six classes is declared the overall winner. The classes are based on the era in which the cars would have competed. The exact class requirements are re-evaluated for every event, since for each event, the age for the youngest entries is shifted by two years. In the first event, five classes ran more short races; later events have featured six classes running fewer but longer races. Drivers are required to have an FIA International Competition license. This event also includes a large Concours d'Elegance and auction.\n\n==See also==\n{{Wikipedia books|Endurance motor racing}}\n*[[24 Hours of Le Mans (motorcycle race)]]\n*[[24 Hours of LeMons]]\n*[[Endurance racing (motorsport)|Endurance racing]]\n*[[Le Mans 24 Hours video games]]\n*[[List of 24 Hours of Le Mans winners]]\n*[[List of 24 hours of Le Mans records]]\n*[[Triple Crown of Motorsport]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n==References==\n* {{fr icon}} Le Mans 1965 in Automobile Historique n°48 May 2005\n* {{fr icon}} 24 heures du Mans 1973 in Automobile Historique n°49 June/July 2005\n\n==External links==\n{{commons|24 Heures du Mans}}\n* [http://www.24h-lemans.com/en/ Le Mans official website]\n* [http://www.racingsportscars.com/photo_lemans.html Racing Sports Cars] – historical photos and results\n* [http://www.lemans-history.com Le Mans History] – The History of Le Mans 24 Hours race\n* [http://www.les24heures.fr 24h of Le Mans History and database]\n\n{{24 Hours of Le Mans}}\n{{Automobile endurance races}}\n{{Coord|47|56|30|N|0|13|30|E|region:FR-72_type:landmark|display=title}}\n{{Use dmy dates|date=April 2013}}\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:24 Hours Of Le Mans}}\n[[Category:24 Hours of Le Mans| ]]\n[[Category:Sarthe]]\n[[Category:Recurring events established in 1923]]\n[[Category:Group C]]\n[[Category:World Sportscar Championship races|Le Mans]]\n[[Category:Tourist attractions in Sarthe]]"

[[World War II by country|The vast majority of the world's countries]]—including all of the [[great power]]s—eventually formed two opposing [[military alliance]]s: the [[Allies of World War II|Allies]] and the [[Axis powers|Axis]]. It was the most global war in history; it directly involved more than 100 million people from over 30 countries. In a state of [[total war]], the major participants threw their entire economic, industrial, and scientific capabilities behind the [[war effort]], blurring the distinction between civilian and military resources. World War II was the [[List of wars and anthropogenic disasters by death toll|deadliest conflict]] in [[History of the world|human history]], marked by 50 to 85 million fatalities, most of which were civilians in the Soviet Union and China.

Infobase Publishing. pp. 659.</ref>, the day of the [[invasion of Poland|invasion]] of [[Second Polish Republic|Poland]] by [[Nazi Germany]] and the subsequent declarations of war on Germany by [[French Third Republic|France]] and the [[United Kingdom]]. From late 1939 to early 1941, in a series of campaigns and [[Tripartite Pact|treaties]], Germany conquered or controlled much of continental Europe, and formed the Axis alliance with [[Kingdom of Italy|Italy]] and [[Empire of Japan|Japan]]. Under the [[Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact]] of August 1939, Germany and the [[Soviet Union]] partitioned and annexed territories of their European neighbours, [[Soviet invasion of Poland|Poland]], [[Winter War|Finland]], [[Soviet occupation of Bessarabia and Northern Bukovina|Romania]] and the [[Occupation of the Baltic states|Baltic states]]. The war continued primarily between the European Axis powers and the coalition of the United Kingdom and the [[Commonwealth of Nations|British Commonwealth]], with campaigns including the [[Western Desert Campaign|North Africa]] and [[East African Campaign (World War II)|East Africa]] campaigns, the aerial [[Battle of Britain]], the [[The Blitz|Blitz bombing campaign]], and the [[Balkan Campaign (World War II)|Balkan Campaign]], as well as the long-running [[Battle of the Atlantic]]. On 22 June 1941, the European Axis powers launched [[Operation Barbarossa|an invasion of the Soviet Union]], opening the [[Eastern Front (World War II)|largest land theatre of war in history]], which trapped the major part of the Axis military forces into a [[Attrition warfare|war of attrition]]. In December 1941, Japan [[Attack on Pearl Harbor|attacked the United States]] and [[Japanese invasion of Malaya|European colonies]] in the Pacific Ocean, and quickly conquered much of the Western Pacific.\n\nThe Axis advance halted in 1942 when Japan lost the critical [[Battle of Midway]], and Germany and Italy were [[Second Battle of El Alamein|defeated in North Africa]] and then, decisively, at [[Battle of Stalingrad|Stalingrad]] in the Soviet Union. In 1943, with a series of German defeats on the [[Eastern Front (World War II)|Eastern Front]], the [[Allied invasion of Sicily]] and the [[Allied invasion of Italy]] which brought about Italian surrender, and Allied victories in the Pacific, the Axis lost the initiative and undertook strategic retreat on all fronts. In 1944, the Western Allies [[Normandy landings|invaded German-occupied France]], while the Soviet Union regained all of its territorial losses and invaded Germany and its allies. During 1944 and 1945 the Japanese suffered major reverses in mainland Asia in [[Second Guangxi Campaign|South]] [[Battle of West Hunan|Central China]] and [[Burma Campaign|Burma]], while the Allies crippled the [[Imperial Japanese Navy|Japanese Navy]] and captured key Western Pacific islands.\n\nThe war in [[Europe]] concluded with an [[Western Allied invasion of Germany|invasion of Germany]] by the Western Allies and the Soviet Union, culminating in the [[Battle of Berlin|capture of Berlin]] by Soviet troops, the [[Death of Adolf Hitler|suicide of Adolf Hitler]] and the subsequent [[German Instrument of Surrender|German unconditional surrender]] on [[Victory in Europe Day|8 May 1945]]. Following the [[Potsdam Declaration]] by the Allies on 26 July 1945 and the refusal of Japan to surrender under its terms, the United States [[Atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki|dropped atomic bombs]] on the Japanese cities of [[Hiroshima]] and [[Nagasaki]] on 6 and 9 August respectively. With an [[Operation Downfall|invasion of the Japanese archipelago]] imminent, the possibility of additional atomic bombings and the [[Soviet invasion of Manchuria]], [[Surrender of Japan|Japan formally surrendered]] on 2 September 1945. Thus ended the war in Asia, cementing the total victory of the Allies.\n\nWorld War&nbsp;II changed the political alignment and social structure of the world. The [[United Nations]] (UN) was established to foster international co-operation and prevent future conflicts. The victorious [[great power]]s—China, France, the Soviet Union, the United Kingdom, and the United States—became the [[Permanent members of the United Nations Security Council|permanent members]] of the [[United Nations Security Council]].<ref name=\"The UN Security Council\">{{Citation|title=The UN Security Council|url=http://www.unfoundation.org/what-we-do/issues/united-nations/the-un-security-council.html|accessdate=15 May 2012}}</ref> The Soviet Union and the United States emerged as rival [[superpower]]s, setting the stage for the [[Cold War]], which lasted for the next 46 years. Meanwhile, the influence of European great powers waned, while the [[decolonisation of Africa]] and [[Decolonisation of Asia|Asia]] began. Most countries whose industries had been damaged moved towards [[Post–World War II economic expansion|economic recovery]].

Meanwhile, the victorious [[Allies of World War I]], such as France, Belgium, Italy, Romania and Greece, gained territory, and new [[nation-states]] were created out of the collapse of Austria-Hungary and the Ottoman and [[Russian Empire]]s.\n\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 102-09042, Genf, Völkerbund, Sitzungssaal.jpg|thumb|right|The [[League of Nations]] assembly, held in [[Geneva]], [[Switzerland]], 1930]]\n\nTo prevent a future world war, the [[League of Nations]] was created during the [[Paris Peace Conference, 1919|1919 Paris Peace Conference]]. The organisation's primary goals were to prevent armed conflict through [[collective security]], military and [[Washington Naval Treaty|naval disarmament]], and settling international disputes through peaceful negotiations and arbitration.\n\nDespite strong [[pacifism|pacifist]] sentiment [[aftermath of World War I|after World War I]],{{sfn|Ingram|2006|pp=[https://books.google.com/books?id=bREQibN9i-sC&pg=PA76 76–8]}} its aftermath still caused [[irredentist]] and [[revanchist]] [[nationalism]] in several European states. These sentiments were especially marked in Germany because of the significant territorial, colonial, and financial losses incurred by the [[Treaty of Versailles]]. Under the treaty, Germany lost around 13 percent of its home territory and all of [[German colonial empire|its overseas possessions]], while German annexation of other states was prohibited, [[World War I reparations|reparations]] were imposed, and limits were placed on the size and capability of the country's [[Reichswehr|armed forces]].{{sfn|Kantowicz|1999|p=149}}\n\nThe German Empire was dissolved in the [[German Revolution of 1918–1919]], and a democratic government, later known as the [[Weimar Republic]], was created. The interwar period saw strife between supporters of the new republic and hardline opponents on both the [[right-wing politics|right]] and [[left-wing politics|left]]. Italy, as an Entente ally, had made some post-war territorial gains; however, Italian nationalists were angered that the [[Treaty of London (1915)|promises made]] by Britain and France to secure Italian entrance into the war were not fulfilled in the peace settlement. From 1922 to 1925, the [[Italian Fascism|Fascist]] movement led by [[Benito Mussolini]] seized power in Italy with a nationalist, [[Totalitarianism|totalitarian]], and [[class collaboration]]ist agenda that abolished representative democracy, repressed socialist, left-wing and liberal forces, and pursued an aggressive expansionist foreign policy aimed at making Italy a [[world power]], promising the creation of a \"[[New Roman Empire]]\".{{sfn|Shaw|2000|p=35}}\n\n[[File:Nürnberg Reichsparteitag Hitler retouched.jpg|thumb|upright|left|[[Adolf Hitler]] at a German [[National Socialist]] political rally in [[Nürnberg]], August 1933]]\n\n[[Adolf Hitler]], after an [[Beer Hall Putsch|unsuccessful attempt to overthrow the German government]] in 1923, eventually became the [[Adolf Hitler's rise to power|Chancellor of Germany in 1933]].

The situation was aggravated in early 1935 when the [[Saar (League of Nations)|Territory of the Saar Basin]] was legally reunited with Germany and Hitler repudiated the Treaty of Versailles, accelerated his rearmament programme, and introduced [[conscription]].{{sfn|Zalampas|1989|p=62}}\n\nTo contain Germany, the United Kingdom, France and Italy formed the [[Stresa Front]] in April 1935; however, that June, the United Kingdom made an [[Anglo-German Naval Agreement|independent naval agreement]] with Germany, easing prior restrictions. The Soviet Union, concerned by [[Drang nach Osten|Germany's goals of capturing vast areas of Eastern Europe]], drafted a treaty of mutual assistance with France. Before taking effect though, the [[Franco-Soviet pact]] was required to go through the bureaucracy of the League of Nations, which rendered it essentially toothless.<ref>{{Harvnb|Mandelbaum|1988|p=96}}; {{Harvnb|Record|2005|p=50}}.</ref> The United States, concerned with events in Europe and Asia, passed the [[Neutrality Acts of 1930s|Neutrality Act]] in August of the same year.{{sfn|Schmitz|2000|p=124}}\n\nHitler defied the Versailles and [[Locarno treaties]] by [[Remilitarization of the Rhineland|remilitarising]] the [[Rhineland]] in March 1936, [[Appeasement|encountering little opposition]].{{sfn|Adamthwaite|1992|p=52}} In October 1936, Germany and Italy formed the [[Rome–Berlin Axis]]. A month later, Germany and Japan signed the [[Anti-Comintern Pact]], which Italy would join in the following year.\n\n===Asia===\nThe [[Kuomintang]] (KMT) party in China launched a [[Northern Expedition|unification campaign]] against [[Warlord Era|regional warlords]] and nominally unified China in the mid-1920s, but was soon embroiled in a [[Chinese Civil War|civil war]] against its former [[Chinese Communist Party]] allies{{sfn|Preston|1998|p=104}} and [[Central Plains War|new regional warlords]]. In 1931, an [[Statism in Shōwa Japan|increasingly militaristic]] [[Empire of Japan]], which had long sought influence in China{{sfn|Myers|Peattie|1987|p=458}} as the first step of what its government saw as the country's [[Hakko ichiu|right to rule Asia]], used the [[Mukden Incident]] as a pretext to [[Japanese invasion of Manchuria|launch an invasion of Manchuria]] and establish the [[puppet state]] of [[Manchukuo]].{{sfn|Smith|Steadman|2004|p=28}}\n\nToo weak to resist Japan, China appealed to the [[League of Nations]] for help. Japan withdrew from the League of Nations after being [[Lytton Report|condemned]] for its incursion into Manchuria. The two nations then fought several battles, in [[28 January Incident|Shanghai]], [[Battle of Rehe|Rehe]] and [[Defense of the Great Wall|Hebei]], until the [[Tanggu Truce]] was signed in 1933.

Colonists who supported the British and opposed the Revolution are referred to as \"Loyalists\" or \"Tories\". The geographical area of the thirteen colonies is often referred to simply as \"America\".|group=N}}\n\nAfter 1765, growing [[American Revolution#Origin|philosophical and political differences]] strained the relationship between Great Britain and its colonies. [[Patriot (American Revolution)|Patriot]] protests against [[No taxation without representation|taxation without representation]] followed the [[Stamp Act 1765|Stamp Act]] and escalated into boycotts, which culminated in 1773 with the [[Sons of Liberty]] [[Boston Tea Party|destroying a shipment of tea]] in Boston Harbor. Britain responded by closing Boston Harbor and passing a series of [[Intolerable Acts|punitive measures]] against Massachusetts Bay Colony. [[Province of Massachusetts Bay|Massachusetts colonists]] responded with the [[Suffolk Resolves]], and they established a shadow government which wrested control of the countryside from the Crown. Twelve colonies formed a [[Continental Congress]] to coordinate their resistance, establishing committees and conventions that effectively seized power.<ref>The colony of Georgia joined later.</ref>\n\nBritish attempts to disarm the Massachusetts militia at [[Concord, Massachusetts|Concord]] in April 1775 [[Battles of Lexington and Concord|led to open combat]]. Militia forces then [[Siege of Boston|besieged Boston]], forcing a British evacuation in March 1776, and Congress appointed [[George Washington]] to command the [[Continental Army]]. Concurrently, an American attempt to [[Invasion of Quebec (1775)|invade Quebec and raise rebellion]] against the British [[Battle of Quebec (1775)|failed decisively]]. On July 2, 1776, the Continental Congress voted for independence, issuing its [[United States Declaration of Independence|declaration]] on July&nbsp;4. [[William Howe, 5th Viscount Howe|Sir William Howe]] launched a [[New York and New Jersey campaign|British counter-offensive]], capturing New York City and leaving American morale at a low ebb. However, victories at [[Battle of Trenton|Trenton]] and [[Battle of Princeton|Princeton]] restored American confidence. In 1777, the British launched an [[Saratoga Campaign|invasion from Quebec]] under [[John Burgoyne]], intending to isolate the [[New England Colonies]]. Instead of assisting this effort, Howe took his army on a separate [[Philadelphia campaign|campaign]] against Philadelphia, and Burgoyne was decisively defeated at [[Battles of Saratoga|Saratoga]] in October 1777.\n\nBurgoyne's defeat had drastic consequences; France formally [[Treaty of Alliance (1778)|allied with the Americans]] and [[France in the American Revolutionary War|entered the war]] in 1778, and Spain [[Spain in the American Revolutionary War|joined the war]] the following year as an [[Pacte de Famille|ally of France]] but not as an ally of the United States. In 1780, the [[Kingdom of Mysore]] [[Second Anglo-Mysore War|attacked the British in India]], and tensions between Great Britain and the Netherlands erupted into [[Fourth Anglo-Dutch War|open war]]. In North America, the British mounted a \"[[Southern theater of the American Revolutionary War|Southern strategy]]\" led by [[Charles Cornwallis, 1st Marquess Cornwallis|Charles Cornwallis]] which hinged upon a [[Loyalist (American Revolution)|Loyalist uprising]], but too few came forward. Cornwallis suffered reversals at [[Battle of Kings Mountain|King's Mountain]] and [[Battle of Cowpens|Cowpens]]. He retreated to Yorktown, Virginia, intending an evacuation, but a decisive [[Battle of the Chesapeake|French naval victory]] deprived him of an escape. A Franco-American army led by the [[Jean-Baptiste Donatien de Vimeur, comte de Rochambeau|Comte de Rochambeau]] and Washington then [[Siege of Yorktown|besieged Cornwallis' army]] and, with no sign of relief, he surrendered in October 1781.\n\n[[Whiggism|Whigs]] in Britain had long opposed the pro-war [[Tory|Tories]] in Parliament, and the surrender gave them the upper hand. In early 1782, Parliament voted to end all offensive operations in North America, but the war continued in Europe and India. Britain remained [[Great Siege of Gibraltar|under siege in Gibraltar]] but scored a [[Battle of the Saintes|major victory]] over the French navy. On September 3, 1783, the belligerent parties signed the [[Treaty of Paris (1783)|Treaty of Paris]] in which Great Britain agreed to recognize the sovereignty of the United States and formally end the war. French involvement had proven decisive,<ref name=\"RichardBrooks\">Brooks, Richard (editor). ''Atlas of World Military History''. HarperCollins, 2000, p. 101 \"Washington's success in keeping the army together deprived the British of victory, but French intervention won the war.\"</ref> but France made few gains and incurred crippling debts. Spain made some minor territorial gains but failed in its primary aim of recovering [[Gibraltar]]. The Dutch were defeated on all counts and were compelled to cede [[Nagapattinam|territory]] to Great Britain. In India, the war against Mysore and its allies [[Treaty of Mangalore|concluded in 1784]] without any territorial changes.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/status%20quo%20ante%20bellum|title=status quo ante bellum|publisher=''Merriam-Webster Online''|accessdate=June 24, 2017}}</ref>\n\n== Background ==\n{{Main|American Revolution}}\n\n=== Early seeds ===\nIn 1651, the [[Parliament of England]] sought to regulate trade in America by passing the [[Navigation Acts#Navigation Act 1651|Navigation Acts]], ensuring that trade [[Mercantilism|only enriched Britain]].<ref>Pestana, Carla Gardina (2004).

Thomas Gage, Commander-in-Chief of North America at the outbreak of the war, was criticized for being too lenient on the rebellious colonists.

After an encouraging success at [[Battle of Camden|Camden]], Cornwallis was poised to invade North Carolina. However, any significant Loyalist support had been effectively destroyed at the [[Battle of Kings Mountain]],<ref name=\"Buchanan, p. 241\"/> and the British Legion, the cream of his army, had been decisively defeated at the [[Battle of Cowpens]].<ref name=\"Buchanan, p. 326\"/> Following both defeats, Cornwallis was fiercely criticized for detaching a significant portion of his army without adequate mutual support.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/> Despite the defeats, Cornwallis chose to proceed into North Carolina, gambling his success upon a large Loyalist uprising which never materialized.<ref name=\"clements.umich.edu\"/><ref name=\"Lumpkin 2000\">Lumpkin, From Savannah to Yorktown: The American Revolution in the South (2000).</ref> As a result, subsequent engagements cost Cornwallis valuable troops he could not replace, as at the [[Battle of Guilford Courthouse]],<ref name=\"MtVernon\" /> and the Americans steadily wore his army down in an exhaustive [[war of attrition]].<ref>Trevelyan, Sir George Otto (1914). George the Third and Charles Fox: The Concluding Part of The American Revolution. New York and elsewhere: Longmans, Green and Co.</ref> Cornwallis had thus left the Carolinas ripe for reconquest. The Americans had largely achieved this aim by the end of 1781, effectively confining the British to the coast, and undoing all the progress they had made in the previous year.<ref>Pancake, John (1985). This Destructive War. University of Alabama Press. {{ISBN|0-8173-0191-7}}., p. 221</ref><ref name=\"ReferenceB\"/>\n\nIn a last-ditch attempt to win the war in the South, Cornwallis resolved to invade Virginia, in order to cut off the American's supply base to the Carolinas. Henry Clinton, Cornwallis' superior, strongly opposed the plan, believing the decisive confrontations would take place between Washington in the North.<ref name=\"ReferenceC\"/> London had approved Cornwallis plan, however they had failed to include Clinton in the decision-making, despite his seniority over Cornwallis, leading to a muddled strategic direction.<ref name=\"Public Record Office\"/> Cornwallis then decided to invade Virginia without informing Clinton of his intentions.<ref>Clinton, H.; ''The American Rebellion''. Note: This lack of notification was one of Clinton's main arguments in his own defense in the controversy that followed the surrender at Yorktown.</ref> Clinton, however, had wholly failed to construct a coherent strategy for British campaigning that year,<ref>{{cite book|last=Grainger|first=John|title=The Battle of Yorktown, 1781: a Reassessment|publisher=Boydell Press|year=2005|location=Woodbridge, NJ|isbn=978-1-84383-137-2|oclc=232006312}}, p. 29</ref> owing to his fractious relationship that he shared with Mariot Arbuthnot, his naval counterpart.<ref name=\"Billias 1969\"/>\n\nAs the Franco-American army approached Cornwallis at Yorktown, he made no attempt to [[sally (military)|sally out]] and engage before siege lines could be erected,<ref>Wickwire, Franklin and Mary (1970).

The Perils of Peace. New York: The Dial Press. {{ISBN|978-0-06-113911-6}}, p. 16</ref>\n\nLike Howe before him, Clinton's efforts to campaign suffered from chronic supply issues. In 1778, Clinton wrote to Germain complaining of the lack of supplies, even after the arrival of a convoy from Ireland.<ref>Colonial Office Papers, 5:96, Clinton to Germain, 15 September 1778</ref> That winter, the supply issue had deteriorated so badly, that Clinton expressed considerable anxiety over how the troops were going to be properly fed.<ref>Colonial Office Papers, 5:97, Clinton to Germain, 15 December 1778</ref> Clinton was largely inactive in the North throughout 1779, launching few major campaigns. This inactivity was partially due to the shortage of food.<ref>Colonial Office Papers, 5:98, Haldimand to Clinton, 19 July and 29 August 1779</ref> By 1780, the situation had not improved. Clinton wrote a frustrated correspondence to Germain, voicing concern that a \"fatal consequence will ensue\" if matters did not improve. By October that year, Clinton again wrote to Germain, angered that the troops in New York had not received \"an ounce\" of that year's allotted stores from Britain.<ref>Colonial Office Papers, 5:100, Clinton to Germain, 31st October 1780</ref>\n\n==== Campaign issues ====\n\nSuppressing a rebellion in America presented the British with major problems. The key issue was distance; it could take up to three months to cross the Atlantic, and orders from London were often outdated by the time that they arrived.<ref>Black (2001), p. 39; Greene and Pole (1999), pp. 298, 306</ref> The colonies had never been formally united prior to the conflict and there was no centralized area of ultimate strategic importance.

They had no national government, no national army or navy, no financial system, no banks, no established credit, and no functioning government departments, such as a treasury. The Congress tried to handle administrative affairs through legislative committees, which proved inefficient. The state governments were themselves brand new and officials had no administrative experience. In peacetime the colonies relied heavily on ocean travel and shipping, but that was now shut down by the British blockade and the Americans had to rely on slow overland travel.\n\nHowever, the Americans had multiple advantages that in the long run outweighed the initial disadvantages they faced. The Americans had a large prosperous population that depended not on imports but on local production for food and most supplies, while the British were mostly shipped in from across the ocean. The British faced a vast territory far larger than Britain or France, located at a far distance from home ports. Most of the Americans lived on farms distant from the seaports—the British could capture any port but that did not give them control over the hinterland. They were on their home ground, had a smoothly functioning, well organized system of local and state governments, newspapers and printers, and internal lines of communications. They had a long-established system of local militia, previously used to combat the French and Native Americans, with companies and an officer corps that could form the basis of local militias, and provide a training ground for the national army created by Congress.<ref name=\"autogenerated1\">Pole and Greene, eds. '' Companion to the American Revolution'', ch. 36–39.</ref>\n\nMotivation was a major asset. The Patriots wanted to win; over 200,000 fought in the war; 25,000 died. The British expected the Loyalists to do much of the fighting, but they did much less than expected. The British also hired German mercenaries to do much of their fighting.<ref name=\"Michael Lanning 2009 195–96\"/>\n\nAt the onset of the war, the Americans had no major international allies. Battles such as the [[Battle of Bennington]], the [[Battles of Saratoga]] and even defeats such as the [[Battle of Germantown]]<ref name=\"Trevelyan, p. 249\">Trevelyan, p. 249.</ref> proved decisive in gaining the attention and support of powerful European nations such as France and Spain, who moved from covertly supplying the Americans with weapons and supplies, to overtly supporting them militarily, moving the war to a global stage.<ref name=\"K405_48\">[[#Ketchum|Ketchum (1997)]], pp. 405–48.</ref>\n\nThe new Continental Army suffered significantly from a lack of an effective training regime, and largely inexperienced officers and sergeants. The inexperience of its officers was compensated for in part by its senior officers; officers such as [[George Washington]], [[Horatio Gates]], [[Charles Lee (general)|Charles Lee]], [[Richard Montgomery]] and [[Francis Marion]] all had military experience with the British Army during the [[French and Indian War]]. The Americans solved their training dilemma during their stint in Winter Quarters at Valley Forge, where they were relentlessly drilled and trained by General [[Friedrich Wilhelm von Steuben]], a veteran of the famed Prussian General Staff. He taught the Continental Army the essentials of military discipline, drills, tactics and strategy, and wrote the [[Revolutionary War Drill Manual]].<ref>Philander D.

Each colony sponsored local [[militia]]. Militiamen were lightly armed, had little training, and usually did not have uniforms. Their units served for only a few weeks or months at a time, were reluctant to travel far from home and thus were unavailable for extended operations, and lacked the training and discipline of soldiers with more experience. If properly used, however, their numbers could help the Continental armies overwhelm smaller British forces, as at the [[Battles of the American Revolutionary War|battles]] of [[Battles of Lexington and Concord|Concord]], [[Battle of Bennington|Bennington]] and [[Saratoga campaign|Saratoga]], and the [[siege of Boston]]. Both sides used partisan warfare but the Americans effectively suppressed Loyalist activity when [[British Regulars|British regulars]] were not in the area.<ref name=\"Black 2001 p. 59\"/>\n\nSeeking to coordinate military efforts, the [[First Continental Congress|Continental Congress]] established a regular army on June 14, 1775, and appointed [[George Washington]] as commander-in-chief. The development of the Continental Army was always a work in progress, and Washington used both his regulars and state militia throughout the war.\n\nThree current branches of the [[United States Military]] trace their institutional roots to the American Revolutionary War; the [[United States Army]] comes from the [[Continental Army]], formed by a resolution of the Continental Congress on June 14, 1775. The [[United States Navy]] recognizes October 13, 1775 as the date of its official establishment, the passage of the resolution of the Continental Congress at Philadelphia that created the [[Continental Navy]].<ref name=Establish>{{Cite web|url=http://www.history.navy.mil/faqs/faq59-13.htm|title=Establishment of the Navy, 13&nbsp;October 1775|publisher=United States Navy|accessdate=November 5, 2009}}</ref>  And the [[United States Marine Corps]] traces its institutional roots to the [[Continental Marines]] of the war, formed  by a resolution of the Continental Congress on November 10, 1775, a date regarded and celebrated as the birthday of the Marine Corps. At the beginning of 1776, Washington's army had 20,000 men, with two-thirds enlisted in the Continental Army and the other third in the various state militias.<ref name=\"Tread\">Crocker (2006), p.&nbsp;51.</ref> At the end of the American Revolution in 1783, both the [[Continental Navy]] and Continental Marines were disbanded. About 250,000 men served as regulars or as militiamen for the Revolutionary cause in the eight years of the war, but there were never more than 90,000 men under arms at one time. About 55,000 American sailors served aboard privateers during the war.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.usmm.org/revolution.html |title=Privateers or Merchant Mariners help win the Revolutionary War |publisher=Usmm.org |date= |accessdate=May 8, 2013}}</ref> The American privateers had almost 1,700 ships, and they captured 2,283 enemy ships.<ref name=\"John Pike\"/> [[John Paul Jones]] became the first great American naval hero, capturing [[HMS Drake (1777)|HMS ''Drake'']] on April 24, 1778, the first victory for any American military vessel in British waters.<ref>Higginbotham (1983), pp.&nbsp;331–46.</ref>\n\nArmies were small by European standards of the era, largely attributable, on the American side, to limitations such as lack of powder and other logistical capabilities; and, on the British side, to the difficulty of transporting troops across the Atlantic, as well as the dependence on local supplies, which the Patriots tried to cut off. The largest force Washington commanded was certainly under 17,000,<ref>Boatner (1974), p.&nbsp;264.</ref> and may have been no more than 13,000 troops, and even the combined American and French forces at the siege of Yorktown amounted to only about 19,000.<ref name=\"Duffy-p13\">Duffy, Christopher (2005).

Because of manpower shortages, George Washington lifted the ban on black enlistment in the Continental Army in January 1776. Small all-black units were formed in [[Rhode Island]] and [[Massachusetts]]; many slaves were promised freedom for serving. Some of the men promised freedom were sent back to their masters, after the war was over, out of political convenience. Another all-black unit came from [[Saint-Domingue]] with French colonial forces.

A few tribes were on friendly terms with the other Americans, but most Indians opposed the union of the Colonies as a potential threat to their territory. Approximately 13,000 Indians fought on the British side, with the largest group coming from the [[Iroquois]] tribes, who fielded around 1,500 men.<ref>Greene and Pole (1999), p.&nbsp;393; Boatner (1974), p.&nbsp;545.</ref> The powerful [[Iroquois Confederacy]] was shattered as a result of the conflict, whatever side they took; the [[Seneca nation|Seneca]], [[Onondaga (tribe)|Onondaga]], and [[Cayuga nation|Cayuga]] nations sided with the British. Members of the [[Mohawk nation]] fought on both sides. Many [[Tuscarora (tribe)|Tuscarora]] and [[Oneida tribe|Oneida]] sided with the colonists. The Continental Army sent the [[Sullivan Expedition]] on raids throughout New York to cripple the Iroquois tribes that had sided with the British. Mohawk leaders [[Joseph Louis Cook]] and [[Joseph Brant]] sided with the Americans and the British respectively, and this further exacerbated the split.\n\nEarly in July 1776, a major action occurred in the fledgling conflict when the [[Cherokee]] allies of Britain attacked the [[Washington District, North Carolina|western frontier areas]] of [[North Carolina Colony|North Carolina]]. Their defeat resulted in a splintering of the Cherokee settlements and people, and was directly responsible for the rise of the [[Chickamauga Cherokee]], bitter enemies of the Colonials who carried on a [[Cherokee–American wars|frontier war]] for decades following the end of hostilities with Britain.<ref name=finger1>John Finger, ''Tennessee Frontiers: Three Regions in Transition'' (Bloomington, Ind.: Indiana University Press, 2001), pp. 43–64.</ref>\n\n[[Muscogee people|Creek]] and [[Seminole]] allies of Britain fought against Americans in Georgia and South Carolina.

He reports that warfare and the farming culture were sometimes incompatible. Militiamen found that living and working on the family farm had not prepared them for wartime marches and the rigors of camp life. Rugged individualism conflicted with military discipline and regimentation. A man's birth order often influenced his military recruitment, as younger sons went to war and older sons took charge of the farm. A person's family responsibilities and the prevalent patriarchy could impede mobilization. Harvesting duties and family emergencies pulled men home regardless of the sergeant's orders. Some relatives might be Loyalists, creating internal strains. On the whole, historians conclude the Revolution's effect on patriarchy and inheritance patterns favored [[egalitarianism]].<ref>William Baller, \"Farm Families and the American Revolution,\" ''Journal of Family History'' (2006) 31(1): 28–44. {{ISSN|0363-1990}}.

The Assembly balanced the competing demands of elite slave-owning planters, [[Plain Folk of the Old South|the middling yeomen]] (some owning a few slaves), and landless indentured servants, among other groups. The Assembly used deferments, taxes, military service substitute, and conscription to resolve the tensions. Unresolved class conflict, however, made these laws less effective. There were violent protests, many cases of evasion, and large-scale desertion, so that Virginia's contributions came at embarrassingly low levels. With the British invasion of the state in 1781, Virginia was mired in class division as its native son, George Washington, made desperate appeals for troops.<ref>Michael A.

The [[First English Civil War|first]] (1642–1646) and [[Second English Civil War|second]] (1648–1649) wars pitted the supporters of [[Charles I of England|King Charles I]] against the supporters of the [[Long Parliament]], while the [[Third English Civil War|third]] (1649–1651) saw fighting between supporters of [[Charles II of England|King Charles II]] and supporters of the [[Rump Parliament]]. The war ended with the Parliamentarian victory at the [[Battle of Worcester]] on 3 September 1651.\n\nThe overall outcome of the war was threefold: [[High Court of Justice for the trial of Charles I|the trial]] and [[execution of Charles I]] (1649); the exile of his son, Charles II (1651); and the replacement of [[English monarchy]] with, at first, the [[Commonwealth of England]] (1649–1653) and then [[the Protectorate]] under the personal rule of [[Oliver Cromwell]] (1653–1658) and subsequently his son [[Richard Cromwell|Richard]] (1658–1659). The monopoly of the [[Church of England]] on Christian worship in England ended with the victors consolidating the established [[Protestant Ascendancy]] in Ireland. Constitutionally, the wars established the precedent that an English monarch cannot govern without [[Parliament of England|Parliament]]'s consent, although the idea of Parliament as the ruling power of England was only legally established as part of the [[Glorious Revolution]] in 1688.{{sfn|EB staff|2016a}}\n\n==Terminology==\nThe term \"English Civil War\" appears most often in the singular form, although historians often divide the conflict into two or three separate wars. These wars were not restricted to [[England]] as [[Wales]] was a part of the Kingdom of England and was affected accordingly, and the conflicts also involved wars with, and civil wars within, both [[Scotland]] and [[Ireland]]. The war in all these countries is known as the [[Wars of the Three Kingdoms]].\n\nUnlike other [[List of English civil wars|civil wars in England]], which focused on who should rule, this war was more concerned with the manner in which the kingdoms of [[Kingdom of England|England]], [[Kingdom of Scotland|Scotland]], and [[Kingdom of Ireland|Ireland]] were governed. The [[Encyclopædia Britannica Eleventh Edition|1911 ''Encyclopædia Britannica'']] called the series of conflicts the \"Great Rebellion\",{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}} while some historians{{spaced ndash}}especially [[Marxist]]s such as [[Christopher Hill (historian)|Christopher Hill]] (1912–2003){{spaced ndash}}have long favoured the term \"[[English Revolution]]\".<ref>{{harvnb|Hill|1972|loc=for example}}.</ref>\n\n==Geography==\nThe two sides had their geographical strongholds, such that minority elements were silenced or fled. The strongholds of the royalty included the countryside, the shires, and the less economically developed areas of northern and western England. On the other hand, all the [[City status in the United Kingdom|cathedral cities]] (except York, Chester, Worcester and Hereford and the royalist stronghold of Oxford) sided with Parliament. All the industrial centers, the ports, and the economically advanced regions of southern and eastern England typically were parliamentary strongholds. Lacey Baldwin Smith says, \"the words ''populous, rich, and rebellious'' seemed to go hand in hand\".{{sfn|Smith|1983|p=251}}{{sfn|Hughes|1985|pp=236–63}}\n\n==Strategy and tactics==\nMany of the officers and veteran soldiers of the English Civil War studied and implemented war strategies that had been learned and perfected in other wars across Europe, namely by the Spanish and the Dutch during the [[Eighty Years' War|Dutch war for independence]] which began in 1568.{{sfn|Baker|1986|p= }}\n\nThe main battle tactic came to be known as [[pike and shot]] infantry, in which the two sides would line up, facing each other, with infantry brigades of [[musketeer]]s in the centre, carrying matchlock muskets; these muskets were inaccurate, but could be lethal at a range of up to 300 yards. The brigades would arrange themselves in lines of musketeers, three deep, where the first row would kneel, the second would crouch, and the third would stand, allowing all three to fire a volley simultaneously.<ref name=\"Simkin\">{{cite web|author=John Simkin |title=The English Civil War – Tactics |orig-year=originally September 1997 |date= August 2014 |access-date=20 April 2015 |url=http://spartacus-educational.com/STUcivilwarMT.htm |publisher=Spartacus Educational}}{{better source|date=April 2015}}</ref> At times there would be two groups of three lines allowing one group to reload while the other group arranged themselves and fired.{{sfn|Burne|Young|1998|p= }}{{page needed|date=April 2015}} Mixed in among the musketeers were pikemen carrying [[pike (weapon)|pikes]] that were between {{convert|12|ft|m|0}} and {{convert|18|ft|m|0}} long, whose primary purpose was to protect the musketeers from cavalry charges. Positioned on each side of the infantry were the cavalry, with a right-wing led by the lieutenant-general, and a left-wing by the commissary general; the main goal of the cavalry was to rout the opponent's cavalry and then turn and overpower their infantry.<ref name=\"Simkin\" /><ref>{{citation |first=Peter |last=Gaunt |title=The English Civil War: A Military History |year=2014 |location=London |publisher=I.B.

While the Parliamentarian cavalry were slower than the cavaliers, they were also better disciplined.<ref name=\"Simkin\" /> The Royalists had a tendency to chase down individual targets after the initial charge leaving their forces scattered and tired.  [[Ironside (cavalry)|Cromwell's cavalry]], on the other hand, trained to operate as a single unit, which led to many decisive victories.<ref>{{citation |first=John |last=Tincey |title=Ironsides: English Cavalry 1588–1688 |year=2012 |page=63 |publisher=Osprey |oclc=842879605 |postscript=. }}</ref>\n\n==Background==\n\n===The King's rule===\n{{History of England}}\nThe English Civil War broke out less than forty years after the death of Queen [[Elizabeth I of England|Elizabeth I]] in 1603. Elizabeth's death had resulted in the succession of her [[Cousin chart|first cousin twice-removed]], [[James VI and I|King James VI of Scotland]], to the English throne as James I of England, creating the first [[Union of the Crowns|personal union of the Scottish and English kingdoms]].{{efn|Although the early 17th century Stuart monarchs styled themselves King of Great Britain, France and Ireland, with the exception of the constitutional arrangements during the [[Interregnum (England)|Interregnum]] (see the [[Tender of Union]]), full union of the Scottish and English realms into a new realm of Great Britain did not occur until the passing of the [[Act of Union 1707]].}} As King of Scots, James had become accustomed to Scotland's weak parliamentary tradition since assuming control of the Scottish government in 1583, so that upon assuming power south of the border, the new King of England was genuinely affronted by the constraints the [[Parliament of England|English Parliament]] attempted to place on him in exchange for money. In spite of this, James' personal extravagance meant he was perennially short of money and had to resort to extra-Parliamentary sources of income.\n\nThis extravagance was tempered by James' peaceful disposition, so that by the succession of his son [[Charles I of England|Charles I]] to the English and Scottish thrones in 1625 the two kingdoms had both experienced relative peace, both internally and in their relations with each other, for as long as anyone could remember. Charles hoped to unite the kingdoms of England, Scotland and Ireland into a new single kingdom, fulfilling the dream of his father.<ref>{{Harvnb|Croft|2003|p=63}}.</ref> Many English Parliamentarians had suspicions regarding such a move because they feared that setting up a new kingdom might destroy the old English traditions which had bound the English monarchy. As Charles shared his father's position on the power of the crown (James had described kings as \"little gods on Earth\", chosen by God to rule in accordance with the doctrine of the \"[[Divine Right of Kings]]\"), the suspicions of the Parliamentarians had some justification.<ref>{{Harvnb|McClelland|1996|p=224}}.</ref>\n\n[[File:King Charles I after original by van Dyck.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Charles I, painted by Van Dyck]]\n\n===Parliament in the English constitutional framework===\nAt the time, the Parliament of England did not have a large permanent role in the English system of government. Instead, Parliament functioned as a temporary advisory committee and was summoned only if and when the monarch saw fit. Once summoned, a parliament's continued existence was at the king's pleasure, since it was subject to dissolution by him at any time.\n\nYet, in spite of this limited role, over the preceding centuries Parliament had acquired ''de facto'' powers of enough significance that monarchs could not simply ignore them indefinitely. For a monarch, Parliament's most indispensable power was its ability to raise tax revenues far in excess of all other sources of revenue at the Crown's disposal. By the seventeenth century, Parliament's tax-raising powers had come to be derived from the fact that the [[gentry]] was the only stratum of society with the ability and authority actually to collect and remit the most meaningful forms of taxation then available at the local level. This meant that if the king wanted to ensure a smooth collection of revenue, he needed the co-operation of the gentry. For all of the Crown's legal authority, by any modern standard, its resources were limited to the extent that, if and when the gentry refused to collect the king's taxes on a national scale, the Crown lacked any practical means with which to compel them.\n\nTherefore, in order to secure their co-operation, monarchs permitted the gentry (and only the gentry) to elect representatives to sit in the [[House of Commons of England|House of Commons]]. When assembled along with the [[House of Lords]], these elected representatives formed a Parliament. The concept of Parliaments therefore allowed representatives of the gentry to meet, primarily (at least in the opinion of the monarch) so that they could give their sanction to whatever taxes the monarch expected their electorate to collect. In the process, the representatives could also confer and send policy proposals to the king in the form of bills. However, Parliament lacked any legal means of forcing its will upon the monarch; its only leverage with the king was the threat of its withholding the financial means required to execute his plans.{{sfn|Johnston|1901|pp=83–86}}\n\n===Parliamentary concerns and the Petition of Right===\n[[File:Sir Peter Lely 001.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Henrietta Maria of France|Henrietta Maria]], painted by [[Peter Lely]], 1660]]\nMany concerns were raised over Charles's marriage to a [[Catholic Church|Roman Catholic]], French princess [[Henrietta Maria of France|Henrietta Maria]], in 1625. The Parliament refused to assign him the traditional right to collect customs duties for his entire reign, deciding instead to grant it only on a provisional basis and negotiate with him.<ref>{{Harvnb|Gregg|1984|pp=129–30}}.</ref>\n\nCharles, meanwhile, decided to send an expeditionary force to relieve the French [[Huguenots]] whom French royal troops held [[Siege of La Rochelle|besieged in La Rochelle]]. Military support for Protestants on the Continent was, in itself, popular both in Parliament and with the Protestant majority in general,{{Citation needed|date=August 2011}} and it had the potential to alleviate concerns brought about by the King's marriage to a Catholic. However, Charles's insistence on having his unpopular royal favourite [[George Villiers, 1st Duke of Buckingham|George Villiers, the Duke of Buckingham]], assume command of the English force undermined that support. Unfortunately for Charles and Buckingham, the relief expedition proved a fiasco (1627),<ref>{{Harvnb|Gregg|1984|p=166}}.</ref> and Parliament, already hostile to Buckingham for his monopoly on [[Patronage|royal patronage]], opened [[impeachment]] proceedings against him.<ref name=Gregg-175>{{Harvnb|Gregg|1984|p=175}}.</ref> Charles responded by dissolving Parliament. This move, while saving Buckingham, reinforced the impression that Charles wanted to avoid Parliamentary scrutiny of his ministers.<ref name=Gregg-175/>\n\nHaving dissolved Parliament and unable to raise money without it, the king assembled a new one in 1628. (The elected members included [[Oliver Cromwell]] and [[Edward Coke]].) The new Parliament drew up the [[Petition of Right]], and Charles accepted it as a concession in order to obtain his subsidy.<ref name=\"Purkiss 2007 93\">{{Harvnb|Purkiss|2007|p=93}}.</ref> Amongst other things, the Petition referred to the [[Magna Carta]].<ref>[[Petition of Right]] at III, VII.</ref> However, it did not grant him the right of [[tonnage and poundage]], which Charles had been collecting without Parliamentary authorisation since 1625.{{sfn|Sommerville|1992|pp=65, 71, 80}} Several of the more active members of the opposition were imprisoned, which caused some outrage;{{sfn|Sommerville|1992|pp=65, 71, 80}} one, [[John Eliot (statesman)|John Eliot]], subsequently died in prison, becoming regarded as a martyr for the rights of Parliament.{{sfn|Russell|1998|p=417}}\n\n===Personal rule===\nCharles I avoided calling a Parliament for the next decade, a period known as the \"[[personal rule of Charles I]]\", or the \"Eleven Years' Tyranny\".<ref>{{Harvnb|Rosner|Theibault|2000|p=103}}.</ref> During this period, Charles's lack of money determined policies. First and foremost, to avoid Parliament, the King needed to avoid war. Charles made peace with France and Spain, effectively ending England's involvement in the [[Thirty Years' War]]. However, that in itself was far from enough to balance the Crown's finances.\n\nUnable to raise revenue without Parliament and unwilling to convene it, Charles resorted to other means. One method was reviving certain conventions, often long-outdated. For example, a failure to attend and to receive [[knighthood]] at Charles's coronation was a finable offence with the fine paid to the Crown. The King also tried to raise revenue through the [[ship money]] tax, by exploiting a naval-war scare in 1635, demanding that the inland English counties pay the tax for the [[Royal Navy]]. Established law supported this policy, but authorities had ignored it for centuries, and many regarded it as yet another extra-Parliamentary (and therefore illegal) tax.<ref name=Pipes-143>{{Harvnb|Pipes|1999|p=143}}.</ref> Some prominent men refused to pay ship money, arguing that the tax was illegal, but they lost in court, and the fines imposed on them for refusing to pay ship money (and for standing against the tax's legality) aroused widespread indignation.<ref name=Pipes-143/>\n\nDuring the \"Personal Rule\", Charles aroused most antagonism through his religious measures: he believed in [[High church|High Anglicanism]], a sacramental version of the [[Church of England]], theologically based upon [[Arminianism in the Church of England|Arminianism]], a creed shared with his main political advisor, Archbishop [[William Laud]].<ref>{{Harvnb|Carlton|1987|p=48}}.</ref> In 1633, Charles appointed Laud as [[Archbishop of Canterbury]] and started making the Church more ceremonial, replacing the wooden [[Mass (liturgy)#Communion rite|communion]] tables with stone altars.<ref>{{Harvnb|Carlton|1987|p=96}}.</ref> Puritans accused Laud of reintroducing Catholicism; when they complained, he had them arrested. In 1637 [[John Bastwick]], [[Henry Burton (Puritan)|Henry Burton]], and [[William Prynne]] had their ears cut off for writing pamphlets attacking Laud's views—a rare penalty for [[Gentleman|gentlemen]], and one that aroused anger.<ref>{{Harvnb|Purkiss|2007|p=201}}.</ref> Moreover, the Church authorities revived the statutes passed in the time of [[Elizabeth I of England|Elizabeth I]] about church attendance and fined Puritans for not attending Anglican church services.<ref>{{Harvnb|Carlton|1987|p=173}}.</ref>\n\n===Rebellion in Scotland===\n{{Main article|Bishops' War}}\nThe end of Charles's independent governance came when he attempted to apply the same religious policies in Scotland. The [[Church of Scotland]], reluctantly [[Episcopal polity|episcopal]] in structure, had independent traditions.<ref>{{Harvnb|Purkiss|2007|p=74}}.</ref> Charles, however, wanted one uniform Church throughout Britain<ref>{{Harvnb|Purkiss|2007|p=83}}.</ref> and introduced a new, High Anglican version of the English [[Book of Common Prayer]] to Scotland in the middle of 1637. This was violently resisted; a riot broke out in Edinburgh,<ref>{{Harvnb|Purkiss|2007|p=75}}.</ref> which may have been started in [[St Giles' Cathedral]], according to legend, by [[Jenny Geddes]].  In February 1638, the Scots formulated their objections to royal policy in the [[National Covenant]].<ref>{{Harvnb|Purkiss|2007|p=77}}.</ref> This document took the form of a \"loyal protest\", rejecting all innovations not first having been tested by free parliaments and General Assemblies of the Church.\n\nIn the spring of 1639, King Charles I accompanied his forces to the Scottish border to end the rebellion known as the [[Bishops' War]].<ref name=Purkiss-96>{{Harvnb|Purkiss|2007|p=96}}.</ref> But, after an inconclusive military campaign, he accepted the offered Scottish truce: the [[Pacification of Berwick]]. The truce proved temporary, and a second war followed in the middle of 1640. This time, a Scots army defeated Charles's forces in the north, then captured [[Newcastle upon Tyne|Newcastle]].<ref>{{Harvnb|Purkiss|2007|p=97}}.</ref> Charles eventually agreed not to interfere with Scotland's religion and paid the Scots' war-expenses.{{Citation needed|date=May 2008}}\n\n===Recall of the English Parliament===\nCharles needed to suppress the rebellion in Scotland. He had insufficient funds, however, and needed to seek money from a newly elected [[Short Parliament|English Parliament]] in 1640.<ref name=Coward-180>{{Harvnb|Coward|2003|p=180}}.</ref> The majority faction in the new Parliament, led by [[John Pym]], took this appeal for money as an opportunity to discuss grievances against the Crown and opposed the idea of an English invasion of Scotland. Charles took exception to this ''[[lese majesty|lèse-majesté]]'' (offence against the ruler) and dissolved the Parliament after only a few weeks; hence the name \"the [[Short Parliament]]\".<ref name=Coward-180/>\n\nWithout Parliament's support, Charles attacked Scotland again, breaking the truce at Berwick, and suffered a comprehensive defeat. The Scots went on to invade England, occupying [[Northumberland]] and [[Durham, England|Durham]].<ref name=Coward-180/> Meanwhile, another of Charles' chief advisors, [[Thomas Wentworth, 1st Earl of Strafford|Thomas Wentworth, 1st Viscount Wentworth]], had risen to the role of Lord Deputy of Ireland in 1632<ref name=Purkiss-89>{{Harvnb|Purkiss|2007|p=89}}.</ref> and brought in much-needed revenue for Charles by persuading the Irish Catholic gentry to pay new taxes in return for promised religious concessions.<ref>{{Harvnb|Coward|2003|p=172}}.</ref>\n\nIn 1639, Charles had recalled Wentworth to England and in 1640 made him Earl of Strafford, attempting to have him achieve similar results in Scotland.<ref name=Purkiss-89/> This time he proved less successful and the English forces fled the field in their second encounter with the Scots in 1640.<ref name=Purkiss-89/> Almost the entirety of Northern England was occupied and Charles was forced to pay £850 per day to keep the Scots from advancing. If he did not, they would \"take\" the money by pillaging and burning the cities and towns of Northern England.<ref>{{Harvnb|Sharp|2000|p=13}}.</ref>\n\nAll this put Charles in a desperate financial position. As King of Scots, he had to find money to pay the Scottish army in England; as King of England, he had to find money to pay and equip an English army to defend England. His means of raising English revenue without an English Parliament fell critically short of achieving this.<ref name=\"Purkiss 2007 93\"/> Against this backdrop, and according to advice from the [[Magnum Concilium]] (the [[House of Lords]], but without the [[House of Commons of England|Commons]], so not a Parliament), Charles finally bowed to pressure and summoned another English Parliament in November 1640.<ref name=Purkiss-96/>\n\n===The Long Parliament===\n{{Main article|Long Parliament}}\n[[File:LongParliament.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Session of the Long Parliament]]\nThe new Parliament proved even more hostile to Charles than its predecessor. It immediately began to discuss grievances against Charles and his government and with Pym and [[John Hampden|Hampden]] (of [[ship money]] fame) in the lead, took the opportunity presented by the King's troubles to force various reforming measures—including many with strong \"anti-Papist\" themes—upon him.<ref>{{Harvnb|Purkiss|2007|pp=104–05}}.</ref> The legislators passed a law which stated that a new Parliament should convene at least once every three years—without the King's summons, if necessary. Other laws passed by the Parliament made it illegal for the king to impose taxes without Parliamentary consent and later gave Parliament control over the king's ministers. Finally, the Parliament passed a law forbidding the King to dissolve it without its consent, even if the three years were up. Ever since, this Parliament has been known as the \"Long Parliament\". However, Parliament did attempt to avert conflict by requiring all adults to sign [[Protestation of 1641|The Protestation]], an oath of allegiance to Charles.{{efn|See {{Harvnb|Walter|1999|p=294}}, for some of the complexities of how the Protestation was interpreted by different political actors.}}\n\nEarly in the Long Parliament's proceedings the house overwhelmingly accused [[Thomas Wentworth, 1st Earl of Strafford|Thomas Wentworth, Earl of Strafford]] of high treason and other crimes and misdemeanours.\n\n[[Henry Vane the Younger]] supplied evidence in relation to Strafford's claimed improper use of the army in Ireland, alleging that Strafford was encouraging the King to use his army raised in Ireland to threaten England into compliance. This evidence was obtained from Vane's father, [[Henry Vane the Elder]], a member of the King's Privy council, who refused to confirm it in Parliament out of loyalty to Charles. On 10 April 1641, Pym's case collapsed, but Pym made a direct appeal to [[Henry Vane the Younger]] to produce a copy of the notes from the King's Privy council, discovered by the younger Vane and secretly turned over to Pym, to the great anguish of the Elder Vane.<ref name=Upham187>{{harvnb|Upham|1842|p=187}}</ref> These notes from the King's Privy Council contained evidence Strafford had told the King, \"Sir, you have done your duty, and your subjects have failed in theirs; and therefore you are absolved from the rules of government, and may supply yourself by extraordinary ways; you have an army in Ireland, with which you may reduce the kingdom.\"{{sfn|Upham|1842|p=187}}{{sfn|Hibbert|1968|p=154}}{{sfn|Carlton|1995|p=224}}\n\nPym immediately launched a Bill of Attainder, stating Strafford's guilt and demanding that the Earl be put to death.{{sfn|Carlton|1995|p=224}} Unlike a guilty finding in a court case, attainder did not require a [[legal burden of proof]], but it did require [[Royal Assent|the king's approval]]. Charles, however, guaranteed Strafford that he would not sign the attainder, without which the bill could not be passed.{{sfn|Carlton|1995|p=225}} Furthermore, the Lords were opposed to the severity of the sentence of death imposed upon Strafford. Yet, increased tensions and [[First Army Plot|a plot]] in the army to support Strafford began to sway the issue.{{sfn|Carlton|1995|p=225}} On 21 April, the Commons passed the Bill (204 in favour, 59 opposed, and 250 abstained),{{sfn|Smith|1999|p=123}} and the Lords acquiesced. Charles, still incensed over the Commons' handling of Buckingham, refused. Strafford himself, hoping to head off the war he saw looming, wrote to the king and asked him to reconsider.{{sfn|Abbott|''Downfall''}} Charles, fearing for the safety of his family, signed on 10 May.{{sfn|Smith|1999|p=123}}  Strafford was beheaded two days later.{{sfn|Coward|1994|p=191}} In the meantime both Parliament and the King agreed to an independent investigation into the king's involvement in Strafford's plot.\n\nThe Long Parliament then passed the [[Triennial Act]], also known as the [[Dissolution Act]] in May 1641, to which the Royal Assent was readily granted.{{sfn|Carlton|1995|p=222}}{{sfn|Kenyon|1978|p=127}} The Triennial Act required that Parliament be summoned at least once every three years, and that when the King failed to issue proper summons, the members could assemble on their own.  This act also forbade ship money without Parliament's consent, fines in destraint of knighthood and forced loans. Monopolies were cut back severely, and the Courts of [[Star Chamber]] and [[Court of High Commission|High Commission]] were abolished by the [[Habeas Corpus Act 1640]] and the Triennial Act respectively.{{sfn|Gregg|1981|p= 335}} All remaining forms of taxation were legalised and regulated by the Tonnage and Poundage Act.{{sfn|Kenyon|1978|p=129}} On 3 May, Parliament decreed [[Protestation of 1641|The Protestation]], attacking the 'wicked counsels' of Charles's government, whereby those who signed the petition undertook to defend 'the true reformed religion', parliament, and the king's person, honour and estate. Throughout May, the House of Commons launched several bills attacking bishops and episcopalianism in general, each time defeated in the Lords.{{sfn|Kenyon|1978|p=130}}{{sfn|Abbott|''Downfall''}}\n\nIt was hoped by both Charles and Parliament that the execution of Strafford and the Protestation would end the drift towards war; in fact, they encouraged it. Charles and his supporters continued to resent Parliament's demands, while Parliamentarians continued to suspect Charles of wanting to impose episcopalianism and unfettered royal rule by military force. Within months, the Irish Catholics, fearing a resurgence of Protestant power, [[Irish Rebellion of 1641|struck first]], and all Ireland soon descended into chaos.<ref>{{Harvnb|Purkiss|2007|pp=109–113}}.</ref> Rumours circulated that the King supported the Irish, and Puritan members of the Commons soon started murmuring that this exemplified the fate that Charles had in store for them all.<ref>See {{Harvnb|Purkiss|2007|p=113}} for the concerns of a similar English Catholic rising.</ref>\n\nIn early January 1642, accompanied by 400 soldiers, Charles attempted to arrest five members of the House of Commons on a charge of treason.<ref name=Sherwood-1997-41>{{Harvnb|Sherwood|1997|p=41}}.</ref> This attempt failed. When the troops marched into Parliament, Charles enquired of [[William Lenthall]], the [[List of Speakers of the House of Commons of England|Speaker]], as to the whereabouts of the five. Lenthall replied, \"May it please your Majesty, I have neither eyes to see nor tongue to speak in this place but as the House is pleased to direct me, whose servant I am here.\"<ref name=Sherwood-1997-41/> In other words, the Speaker proclaimed himself a servant of Parliament, rather than of the King.<ref name=Sherwood-1997-41/>\n\n===Local grievances===\nIn the summer of 1642 these national troubles helped to polarise opinion, ending indecision about which side to support or what action to take. Opposition to Charles also arose owing to many local grievances. For example, the imposition of drainage schemes in [[The Fens]] negatively affected the livelihood of thousands of people after the King awarded a number of drainage contracts.<ref>{{Harvnb|Hughes|1991|p=127}}.</ref> Many regarded the King as indifferent to public welfare, and this played a role in bringing a large part of eastern England into the Parliamentarian camp. This sentiment brought with it people such as the [[Edward Montagu, 2nd Earl of Manchester|Earl of Manchester]] and [[Oliver Cromwell]], each a notable wartime adversary of the King. Conversely, one of the leading drainage contractors, the [[Robert Bertie, 1st Earl of Lindsey|Earl of Lindsey]], was to die fighting for the King at the [[Battle of Edgehill]].<ref>{{Harvnb|Purkiss|2007|p=180}}.</ref>\n\n==First English Civil War (1642–1646)==\n{{Main article|First English Civil War}}\n[[File:English civil war map 1642 to 1645.JPG|thumb|Maps of territory held by Royalists (red) and Parliamentarians (green), 1642–1645]]\n\nIn early January 1642, a few days after his failure to capture five members of the House of Commons, fearing for the safety of his family and retinue, Charles left the London area for the north of the country.<ref>{{Harvnb|Wedgwood|1970|p=57}}.</ref> Further negotiations by frequent correspondence between the King and the [[Long Parliament]] through to early summer proved fruitless. As the summer progressed, cities and towns declared their sympathies for one faction or the other: for example, the garrison of Portsmouth under the command of Sir [[George Goring, Lord Goring|George Goring]] declared for the King,<ref>{{Harvnb|Wedgwood|1970|p=107}}.</ref> but when Charles tried to acquire arms for his cause from [[Kingston upon Hull]], the depository for the weapons used in the previous Scottish campaigns, Sir [[Sir John Hotham, 1st Baronet|John Hotham]], the military governor appointed by Parliament in January, refused to let Charles enter Hull,<ref>{{Harvnb|Wedgwood|1970|p=82}}.</ref> and when Charles returned with more men later, [[Siege of Hull (1642)|Hotham drove them off]].<ref name=\"Wedgwood 1970 100\">{{Harvnb|Wedgwood|1970|p=100}}.</ref> Charles issued a warrant for Hotham to be arrested as a traitor but was powerless to enforce it.

Historians estimate that between them, both sides had only about 15,000 men.{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}} However, the war quickly spread and eventually involved every level of society. Many areas attempted to remain neutral. Some formed bands of [[Clubmen]] to protect their localities against the worst excesses of the armies of both sides,<ref>{{Harvnb|Wedgwood|1970|pp=403–04}}.</ref> but most found it impossible to withstand both the King and Parliament. On one side, the King and his supporters fought for traditional government in Church and state. On the other, most supporters of the Parliamentary cause initially took up arms to defend what they thought of as the traditional balance of government in Church and state, which the bad advice the King had received from his advisers had undermined before and during the \"Eleven Years' Tyranny\". The views of the members of parliament ranged from unquestioning support of the King—at one point during the First Civil War, more members of the Commons and Lords gathered in the King's [[Oxford Parliament (1644)|Oxford Parliament]] than at [[Palace of Westminster|Westminster]]—through to radicals, who wanted major reforms in favour of [[Nonconformism|religious independence]] and the redistribution of power at the national level. However, even the most radical supporters of the Parliamentarian cause still favoured the retention of Charles on the throne.{{Citation needed|date=May 2008|reason=For all information since the last citation}}\n\nAfter the [[Siege of Hull (1642)|debacle at Hull]], Charles moved on to [[Nottingham]], where on 22 August 1642, he raised the [[Royal Standard of England|royal standard]].<ref>{{Harvnb|Wedgwood|1970|p=111}}.</ref> When he raised his standard, Charles had with him about 2,000 cavalry and a small number of Yorkshire infantry-men, and using the archaic system of a [[Commission of Array]],<ref>{{Harvnb|Wedgwood|1970|p=96}}.</ref> Charles's supporters started to build a larger army around the standard.

As in the case of Kingston upon Hull, they had taken measures to secure strategic towns and cities by appointing to office men sympathetic to their cause, and on 9 June they had voted to raise an army of 10,000 volunteers and appointed [[Robert Devereux, 3rd Earl of Essex]] commander three days later.<ref>{{Harvnb|Wedgwood|1970|pp=108–09}}.</ref> He received orders \"to rescue His Majesty's person, and the persons of the [[Charles II of England|Prince [of Wales]]] and the [[James II of England|Duke of York]] out of the hands of those desperate persons who were about them\".<ref>{{Harvnb|Hibbert|1993|p=65}}.</ref> The [[Lord Lieutenant|Lords Lieutenant]], whom Parliament appointed, used the [[Militia Ordinance]] to order the militia to join Essex's army.<ref>{{Harvnb|Royle|2006|pp=161, 165}}.</ref>\n\nTwo weeks after the King had raised his standard at Nottingham, Essex led his army north towards [[Northampton]],<ref>{{Harvnb|Wedgwood|1970|p=113}}.</ref> picking up support along the way (including a detachment of [[Cambridgeshire]] cavalry raised and commanded by [[Oliver Cromwell]]).{{efn|Cromwell had already secured Cambridge and the supplies of college silver {{Harv|Wedgwood|1970|p=106}}.}} By the middle of September Essex's forces had grown to 21,000 infantry and 4,200 cavalry and [[dragoon]]s. On 14 September he moved his army to [[Coventry]] and then to the north of the [[Cotswolds]],<ref>Wegwood, p.115.</ref> a strategy which placed his army between the Royalists and London. With the size of both armies now in the tens of thousands, and only Worcestershire between them, it was inevitable that cavalry reconnaissance units would sooner or later meet. This happened in the first major skirmish of the Civil War, when a cavalry troop of about 1,000 Royalists commanded by [[Prince Rupert]], a German nephew of the King and one of the outstanding cavalry commanders of the war,<ref>{{Harvnb|Wedgwood|1970|p=148}}.</ref> defeated a Parliamentary cavalry detachment under the command of Colonel John Brown in the [[Battle of Powick Bridge]], at a bridge across the [[River Teme]] close to [[Worcester]].<ref>{{Harvnb|Royle|2006|pp=171–88}}.</ref>\n\n[[File:Rupert of the Rhine.jpg|thumb|[[Prince Rupert of the Rhine]]]]\n\nRupert withdrew to Shrewsbury, where a council-of-war discussed two courses of action: whether to advance towards Essex's new position near [[Worcester]], or to march along the now opened road towards London. The Council decided to take the London route, but not to avoid a battle, for the Royalist generals wanted to fight Essex before he grew too strong, and the temper of both sides made it impossible to postpone the decision. In the [[Edward Hyde, 1st Earl of Clarendon|Earl of Clarendon's]] words: \"it was considered more counsellable to march towards London, it being morally sure that the earl of Essex would put himself in their way\".{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=404}} Accordingly, the army left Shrewsbury on 12 October, gaining two days' start on the enemy, and moved south-east.

A Scottish army, assembled under the command of [[David Leslie (Scottish general)|David Leslie]], tried to block the retreat, but Cromwell defeated them at the [[Battle of Dunbar (1650)|Battle of Dunbar]] on 3 September.

[[John Calvin]] formulated a doctrine of [[Presbyterianism]], which held that in the New Testament the offices of ''presbyter'' and ''episkopos'' were identical; he rejected the doctrine of [[apostolic succession]]. Calvin's follower [[John Knox]] brought Presbyterianism to [[Scotland]] when the Scottish church was reformed in 1560. In practice, Presbyterianism meant that committees of lay elders had a substantial voice in church government, as opposed to merely being subjects to a ruling [[hierarchy]].\n\nThis vision of at least partial [[democracy]] in [[ecclesiology]] paralleled the struggles between [[Parliament of England|Parliament]] and [[List of English monarchs|the King]]. A body within the [[Puritan]] movement in the [[Church of England]] sought to abolish the office of bishop and remake the Church of England along Presbyterian lines. The [[Martin Marprelate]] tracts (1588–1589), applying the [[pejorative]] name of ''[[prelate|prelacy]]'' to the church hierarchy, attacked the office of bishop with satire that deeply offended [[Elizabeth I of England|Elizabeth I]] and her [[Archbishop of Canterbury]] [[John Whitgift]]. The [[vestments controversy]] also related to this movement, seeking further reductions in church ceremony, and labelling the use of elaborate vestments as \"unedifying\" and even [[idolatry and Christianity|idolatrous]].\n\n[[James I of England|King James I]], reacting against the perceived contumacy of his Presbyterian Scottish subjects, adopted \"No Bishop, no King\" as a slogan; he tied the hierarchical authority of the bishop to the absolute authority he sought as king, and viewed attacks on the authority of the bishops as attacks on his own authority. Matters came to a head when King [[Charles I of England|Charles I]] appointed [[William Laud]] as the [[Archbishop of Canterbury]]; Laud aggressively attacked the Presbyterian movement and sought to impose the full [[Book of Common Prayer|Anglican liturgy]]. The controversy eventually led to Laud's [[impeachment]] for [[treason]] by a [[bill of attainder]] in 1645, and subsequent execution. Charles also attempted to impose episcopacy on Scotland; the Scots' violent rejection of bishops and liturgical worship sparked the [[Bishops' Wars]] in 1639–1640.\n\nDuring the height of Puritan power in [[Commonwealth of England|the Commonwealth]] and [[the Protectorate]], episcopacy was formally abolished in the Church of England on 9 October 1646.{{sfn|King|1968|p=523–37}} The Church of England remained Presbyterian until the [[English Restoration|Restoration]] of the monarchy with [[Charles II of England|Charles II]] in 1660.<ref>{{harvnb|Plant|2002|loc=}}. {{better source|date=July 2012}}</ref>\n\n==English overseas possessions==\n{{details|English overseas possessions in the Wars of the Three Kingdoms}}\nDuring the period of the English Civil War, the English overseas possessions were highly involved. In the [[Channel Islands in the Wars of the Three Kingdoms|Channel Islands]], the island of Jersey and [[Castle Cornet]] in Guernsey supported the King until in December 1651 they surrendered with honour. Although the newer, Puritan settlements in North America, most notably [[Massachusetts]], were dominated by Parliamentarians, the older colonies sided with the Crown. Friction between royalists and Puritans in Maryland came to a head in the [[Battle of the Severn]]. The [[Virginia Company of London|Virginia Company's]] settlements, [[Bermuda]] and [[Virginia]], as well as [[Antigua]] and [[Barbados]] were conspicuous in their loyalty to the Crown. Bermuda's Independent Puritans were expelled, settling the [[Bahamas]] under [[William Sayle]] as the [[Eleutheran Adventurers]]. Parliament passed [[An Act for prohibiting Trade with the Barbadoes, Virginia, Bermuda and Antego]] in October, 1650, which stated that ''due punishment [be] inflicted upon the said Delinquents, do Declare all and every the said persons in Barbada's, Antego, Bermuda's and Virginia, that have contrived, abetted, aided or assisted those horrid Rebellions, or have since willingly joyned with them, to be notorious Robbers and Traitors, and such as by the Law of Nations are not to be permitted any maner of Commerce or Traffique with any people whatsoever; and do forbid to all maner of persons, Foreiners, and others, all maner of Commerce, Traffique and Correspondency whatsoever, to be used or held with the said Rebels in the Barbada's, Bermuda's, Virginia and Antego, or either of them.''\n\nThe Act also authorised Parliamentary [[privateer]]s to act against English vessels trading with the rebellious colonies: ''All Ships that Trade with the Rebels may be surprized. Goods and tackle of such ships not to be embezeled, till judgement in the Admiralty.; Two or three of the Officers of every ship to be examined upon oath.''\n\nThe Parliament began assembling a fleet to invade the Royalist colonies, but many of the English islands in the Caribbean were captured by the Dutch and French in 1651 during the [[Second Anglo-Dutch War]]. Far to the North, Bermuda's regiment of Militia and its coastal batteries prepared to resist an invasion that never came. The colony made a separate peace that respected its internal status quo. The [[Parliament of Bermuda]] avoided the Parliament of England's fate during [[The Protectorate]], becoming one of the oldest continuous legislatures in the world.\n\nVirginia's population swelled with Cavaliers during and after the English Civil War. Even so, Virginia Puritan [[Richard Bennett (Governor)|Richard Bennett]] was made Governor answering to Cromwell in 1652, followed by two more nominal \"Commonwealth Governors\". The loyalty of Virginia's [[Virginia Cavaliers (historical)|Cavaliers]] to the Crown was rewarded after the 1660 [[English Restoration|Restoration of the Monarchy]] when King Charles II dubbed it the ''Old Dominion''.\n\n==Casualties==\nAs usual in wars of this era, disease caused more deaths than combat. There are no accurate figures for these periods, and it is not possible to give a precise overall figure for those killed in battle, as opposed to those who died from disease, or even from a natural decline in population.\n\nFigures for casualties during this period are unreliable, but some attempt has been made to provide rough estimates.<ref>{{harvnb|White|2012|loc=}}. {{better source|date=July 2012}}</ref><ref name=Carlton-211-214>{{Harvnb|Carlton|1992|loc=[https://books.google.com/books?id=tVugNXnVrVAC&pg=PP10&lpg=PP9&ots=R_1h4VBt52&dq=Going+to+the+Wars&lr=&sig=jeEvvoXbdxT3_3ioIDjDA7GWqwQ#PPA211,M1 pp. 211–14]}}.</ref>\nIn England, a conservative estimate is that roughly 100,000 people died from war-related disease during the three civil wars.

Casualties include the deaths of prisoners-of-war in conditions that accelerated their deaths, with estimates of 10,000 prisoners not surviving or not returning home (8,000 captured during and immediately after the [[Battle of Worcester]] were deported to [[New England]], [[Bermuda]] and the [[West Indies]] to work for landowners as [[indentured labour]]ers<ref>{{Harvnb|Royle|2006|p=602}}.</ref>). There are no figures to calculate how many died from war-related diseases, but if the same ratio of disease to battle deaths from English figures is applied to the Scottish figures, a not unreasonable estimate of 60,000 people is achieved,<ref name=Carlton-212>{{Harvnb|Carlton|1992|loc=[https://books.google.com/books?id=tVugNXnVrVAC&pg=PP10&lpg=PP9&ots=R_1h4VBt52&dq=Going+to+the+Wars&lr=&sig=jeEvvoXbdxT3_3ioIDjDA7GWqwQ#PPA212,M1 p. 212]}}.</ref> from a population of about one million.<ref name=James-187/>\n\nFigures for Ireland are described as \"miracles of conjecture\". Certainly the devastation inflicted on Ireland was massive, with the best estimate provided by Sir [[William Petty]], the father of English demography. Petty estimates that 112,000 Protestants and 504,000 Catholics were killed through [[Black Death|plague]], war and [[famine]], giving an estimated total of 616,000 dead,<ref name=Carlton-213>{{Harvnb|Carlton|1992|loc=[https://books.google.com/books?id=tVugNXnVrVAC&pg=PP10&lpg=PP9&ots=R_1h4VBt52&dq=Going+to+the+Wars&lr=&sig=jeEvvoXbdxT3_3ioIDjDA7GWqwQ#PPA213,M1 p. 213]}}.</ref> from a pre-war population of about one and a half million.<ref name=James-187/> Although Petty's figures are the best available, they are still acknowledged as being tentative; they do not include the estimate of 40,000 driven into exile, some of whom served as soldiers in European continental armies, while others were sold as indentured servants to New England and the West Indies. Many of those sold to landowners in New England eventually prospered, but many of those sold to landowners in the West Indies were worked to death.\n\nThese estimates indicate that England suffered a 3.7% loss of population, Scotland a loss of 6%, while Ireland suffered a loss of 41% of its population. Putting these numbers into the context of other catastrophes helps to understand the devastation to Ireland in particular. The [[Great Hunger]] of 1845–1852 resulted in a loss of 16% of the population, while during the Second World War the population of the Soviet Union fell by 16%.<ref name=Carlton-214>{{Harvnb|Carlton|1992|loc=[https://books.google.com/books?id=tVugNXnVrVAC&pg=PP10&lpg=PP9&ots=R_1h4VBt52&dq=Going+to+the+Wars&lr=&sig=jeEvvoXbdxT3_3ioIDjDA7GWqwQ#PPA214,M1 p. 214]}}.</ref>\n\n==Popular gains==\nOrdinary people took advantage of the dislocation of civil society during the 1640s to derive advantages for themselves.

In the wake of victory, many of the ideals (and many of the idealists) became sidelined. The republican government of the [[Commonwealth of England]] ruled England (and later all of Scotland and Ireland) from 1649 to 1653 and from 1659 to 1660. Between the two periods, and due to in-fighting amongst various factions in Parliament, [[Oliver Cromwell]] ruled over [[the Protectorate]] as [[Lord Protector]] (effectively a military dictator) until his death in 1658.{{efn|For a longer analysis of the relationship between Cromwell's position, the former monarchy and the military, see {{Harvnb|Sherwood|1997|pp=7–11}}.}}\n\nUpon his death, Oliver Cromwell's son [[Richard Cromwell|Richard]] became Lord Protector, but the Army had little confidence in him.<ref>{{Harvnb|Keeble|2002|p=6}}.</ref> After seven months the Army removed Richard, and in May 1659 it re-installed the Rump.<ref>{{Harvnb|Keeble|2002|p=9}}.</ref> However, since the Rump Parliament acted as though nothing had changed since 1653 and as though it could treat the Army as it liked, military force shortly afterwards dissolved this, as well.<ref>{{Harvnb|Keeble|2002|p=12}}.</ref> After the second dissolution of the Rump, in October 1659, the prospect of a total descent into anarchy loomed as the Army's pretence of unity finally dissolved into factions.<ref>{{Harvnb|Keeble|2002|p=34}}.</ref>\n[[File:Musket volley by Sealed Knot.JPG|thumb|left|A historical civil war re-enactment]]\nInto this atmosphere General [[George Monck, 1st Duke of Albemarle|George Monck]], Governor of Scotland under the Cromwells, marched south with his army from Scotland.

On 29 May 1660, the populace in London acclaimed him as king.<ref>{{Harvnb|Lodge|2007|pp=5–6}}.</ref> His coronation took place at [[Westminster Abbey]] on 23 April 1661. These events became known as the ''[[Restoration (England)|Restoration]]''.<ref>{{Harvnb|Lodge|2007|p=6}}.</ref>\n\nAlthough the monarchy was restored, it was still only with the consent of Parliament; therefore, the civil wars effectively set England and Scotland on course to adopt a [[parliamentary monarchy]] form of government.<ref>{{Harvnb|Lodge|2007|p=8}}.</ref> This system would result in the outcome that the future [[Kingdom of Great Britain]], formed in 1707 under the [[Act of Union 1707|Acts of Union]], would manage to forestall the kind of often-bloody revolution, typical of European republican movements that followed the [[Jacobin (politics)|Jacobin]] revolution in 18th century France and the later success of [[Napoleon]], which generally resulted in the total abolition of monarchy. It was no coincidence that the United Kingdom was spared the wave of revolutions that occurred in Europe in the 1840s. Specifically, future monarchs became wary of pushing Parliament too hard, and Parliament effectively chose the line of royal succession in 1688 with the [[Glorious Revolution]] and in the 1701 [[Act of Settlement 1701|Act of Settlement]]. After the [[English Restoration|Restoration]], Parliament's factions became political parties (later becoming the [[Tory|Tories]] and [[Whig (UK)|Whigs]]) with competing views and varying abilities to influence the decisions of their monarchs.{{Citation needed|date=May 2008|reason=For the whole paragraph}}\n\n==Historiography and explanations==\nIn the early decades of the 20th century the [[Whig history|Whig school]] was the dominant theoretical view. They explained the Civil War as resulting from a centuries-long struggle between Parliament (especially the House of Commons) and the Monarchy, with Parliament defending the traditional rights of Englishmen, while the Stuart monarchy continually attempted to expand its right to arbitrarily dictate law. The most important Whig historian, [[Samuel Rawson Gardiner|S.R. Gardiner]],{{full citation needed|date=April 2017}} popularised the idea that the English Civil War was a \"Puritan Revolution\": challenging the repressive Stuart Church, and preparing the way for [[religious toleration]] in the Restoration. Thus, Puritanism was the natural ally of a people preserving their traditional rights against arbitrary monarchical power.\n\nThe Whig view was challenged and largely superseded by the [[Marxism|Marxist]] school, which became popular in the 1940s, and which interpreted the English Civil War as a [[bourgeois]] revolution. According to Marxist historian [[Christopher Hill (historian)|Christopher Hill]]:\n\n{{quote|The Civil War was a class war, in which the despotism of Charles I was defended by the reactionary forces of the established Church and conservative landlords, Parliament beat the King because it could appeal to the enthusiastic support of the trading and industrial classes in town and countryside, to the yeomen and progressive gentry, and to wider masses of the population whenever they were able by free discussion to understand what the struggle was really about.<ref>{{Harvnb|Kaye|1995|loc=[https://books.google.com/books?id=w6xVLvqihBoC&pg=PA106&hl=en&ei=5dICTMP1BM6TkAWVioS2DQ&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=3&ved=0CDIQ6AEwAg#v=onepage&q&f=false p. 106]}} quoting Hill from his pamphlet ''The English Revolution 1640''</ref>}}\n\nIn the 1970s, [[historical revisionism|revisionist historians]] challenged both the Whig and the Marxist theories,<ref name=Burgess>{{harvnb|Burgess|1990|pp=609–27}}.</ref> notably in the 1973 anthology ''The Origins of the English Civil War'' ([[Conrad Russell]] ed.).{{sfn|Russell|1973|p={{Page needed|date=April 2017}} }} These historians produced work focused on the minutiae of the years immediately preceding the civil war, thereby returning to the contingency-based historiography of [[Edward Hyde, 1st Earl of Clarendon|Clarendon's]] famous contemporary history ''History of the Rebellion and Civil Wars in England''.{{Harvnb|Gaunt|2000|p=60}} This, it was claimed, demonstrated that factional war-allegiance patterns did not fit either Whig or Marxist history.<ref>{{Harvnb|Gaunt|2000|p=60}}.</ref> Parliament was not inherently progressive, with the events of 1640 a precursor for the [[Glorious Revolution]],<ref>{{Harvnb|Gaunt|2000|pp=60–61}}.</ref> nor did Puritans necessarily ally themselves with Parliamentarians.{{Citation needed|date=September 2008}}  Many members of the bourgeoisie fought for the King, while many landed aristocrats supported Parliament.

For example, the wars began when King Charles I tried imposing an Anglican Prayer Book upon Scotland, and when this was met with resistance from the [[Covenanter]]s, he needed an army to impose his will. However, this forced him to call an English Parliament to raise new taxes to pay for the army. The English Parliaments were not willing to grant Charles the revenue he needed to pay for the Scottish expeditionary army unless he addressed their grievances. By the early 1640s, Charles was left in a state of near permanent crisis management; often he was not willing to concede enough ground to any one faction to neutralise the threat, and in some circumstances to do so would only antagonise another faction. For example, Charles finally agreed upon terms with the Covenanters in August 1641, but although this might have weakened the position of the English Parliament, the [[Irish Rebellion of 1641]] broke out in October 1641, largely negating the political advantage he had obtained by relieving himself of the cost of the Scottish invasion.{{sfn|Ohlmeyer|2002}}\n\n[[Thomas Hobbes]] gives a much earlier historical account of the English Civil War in his essay [[Behemoth (Hobbes book)|Behemoth]], written in 1668 and published in 1681. He reports that the causes of the war were the doctrines of politics and conflicts that arose from science that disputed those political doctrines.{{sfn|Hobbes|1839|p=220}}\n\nBehemoth offered a uniquely historical and philosophical approach to naming the catalysts for the war. It also served as a political statement to explain why King Charles I was incapable of holding his place of power and maintaining peace in his kingdom.{{sfn|Kraynak|1990|p=33}}\n\nSpecifically, Hobbes analyses the following aspects of English thought during the war (listed in order of his discussions in Behemoth): the opinions of divinity and politics that spurred rebellion; rhetoric and doctrine used by the rebels against the king; and how opinions about \"taxation, the conscription of soldiers, and military strategy\" affected the outcomes of battles and shifts of sovereignty.{{sfn|Kraynak|1990|p=33}}\n\nHobbes offered a unique contribution to historical interpretation of the civil war through his Behemoth by connecting the civil war to the motivations of intellectuals who Hobbes reports caused it by trying to spread certain ideas throughout the nation, largely for the sake of displaying their own wisdom and learning.{{sfn|Goldsmith|1966|pp=x–xiii}}\n\nHobbes held the belief that clerical pretensions had contributed significantly to the trouble during the civil war—\"whether those of puritan fundamentalists, papal supremacists or divine right Episcopalians\".{{sfn|Sommerville|2012}} Hobbes wanted to revoke all of independent power of the clergy and to change the civil system such that they were controlled by the state.\n\nSome scholars suggest that Behemoth has not received its due respect as an academic work, being comparatively overlooked and underrated in the shadow of [[Leviathan (Hobbes book)|Leviathan]].{{sfn|Kraynak|1990|p= }}{{page needed|date=September 2016}}{{sfn|Macgillivray|1970|p=179}} One factor that may have contributed to its lack of reception as a historical work is that it takes the form of a dialogue. While philosophical dialogues are common, historical ones are not. Other factors that hindered its success include King Charles II's refusing its publication and Hobbes' chiefly interpretive approach to the historical narrative.{{sfn|Macgillivray|1970|p=179}}\n\nMuch can be gleaned about Hobbes as a person from looking at the difficulties he faced while seeking an audience for Behemoth. The essay illuminates a flaw shared by most of Hobbes's political philosophy as well, which is his lack of ability or willingness to empathize with perspectives that largely differed from his own. As his perspective was so much at odds with other views, Hobbes struggled to understand the thinking of most of his potential audience and people in general.{{sfn|Macgillivray|1970|p=179}}  For instance, he accredits the Presbyterians and Parliamentarians with \"improbably long-planned and wicked ambitions\".{{sfn|Macgillivray|1970|p=179}} What's more, \"he hardly understands the orthodox Royalists (he was himself a highly unorthodox Royalist) any better, and he makes only limited concessions of sincerity to the religious feelings of the various parties\".{{sfn|Macgillivray|1970|p=179}}\n\n==Re-enactments==\n[[File:Civil war reeanactment.JPG|thumb|right|A historical civil war re-enactment]]\nTwo large historical societies exist, [[The Sealed Knot (reenactment)|The Sealed Knot]] and [[The English Civil War Society]], which regularly [[English Civil War reenactment|re-enact]] events and battles of the Civil War in full period costume.\n\n==See also==\n* [[Timeline of the English Civil War]], showing events leading up to, culminating in, and resulting from the English Civil Wars.\n* [[First English Civil War, 1642]]\n* [[First English Civil War, 1643]]\n* [[First English Civil War, 1644]]\n* [[First English Civil War, 1645]]\n* [[First English Civil War, 1646]]\n* [[Cromwell's Soldiers' Pocket Bible]], booklet Cromwell issued to his army in 1643.\n* [[English Dissenters]]\n* [[William Hiseland]], the last Royalist veteran of the Civil War\n* [[Thirty Years' War]], a defining event in European history during the reign of Charles I.\n* The [[Levellers]], a movement for political reform.\n* [[Diggers]]\n<!-- * [[Tyne-Wear rivalry#Origins of the rivalry]] --Needs a source that the Tyne-Wear rivalry is partially based on the Civil War and not just on FTM -->\n\n{{clear}}\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist|group=lower-alpha}}\n{{Reflist|20em}}\n\n==References==\n{{Refbegin|3}}\n* {{Citation |ref={{sfnRef|Abbott|''Downfall''}} |last=Abbott |first=Jacob |url=http://www.mainlesson.com/display.php?author=abbott&book=charles1&story=_contents |title=Charles I |chapter=Chapter: Downfall of Strafford and Laud |chapterurl=http://www.mainlesson.com/display.php?author=abbott&book=charles1&story=downfall}}\n* {{Citation |last=Atkin |first=Malcolm |title=Worcester 1651 |publisher=Pen and Sword |year=2008 |isbn=978-1-84415-080-9|location = Barnsley|pages = }}\n* {{Citation |last=Aylmer |first=G.

Purses declined as a result of the Great Depression, with War Admiral earning only $28,020 in 1937, then began to recover.

The 126 pounds comes from the [[English Classic Races|English Classics]], where the standard weight is 9 stone, with one stone equaling 14 pounds. In 1913, the Belmont was run as a handicap with the winner carrying only 109 pounds compared to the runner-up carrying 126 pounds. Races run prior to 1900 had varied weight conditions.<ref name =PastWinners />\n\nThe first post parade in the United States was at the 14th Belmont, in 1880. Before 1921, the race was run in the clockwise tradition of English racing. Since then, the race has been run in the American, or counter-clockwise, direction. Because of its length (one lap around the enormous Belmont main track), and because it is the final race of the Triple Crown, it is called the \"Test of the Champion\". Most three-year-olds are unaccustomed to the distance, and lack the experience, if not the [[endurance|stamina]], to maintain a winning speed for so long. In a long race such as the Belmont, positioning of the horse and the timing of the move to chase for the lead can be critical.\n\n==Traditions==\n\n[[File:Winners blanket for the Belmont Stakes.jpg|thumb|The winner's blanket, made of white carnations]]The Belmont Stakes is traditionally called \"The Test of the Champion\" because of its 1.5 mile length — by far the longest of the three Triple Crown races, and one of the longest for a first-class race in the United States on the dirt. It is also known as \"The Run for the Carnations\" because the winning horse is draped with a blanket of [[Dianthus caryophyllus|white carnations]] after the race, in similar fashion to the blanket of [[rose]]s and [[Rudbeckia|black-eyed Susan]]s for the Derby and Preakness, respectively. The winning owner is ceremonially presented with the silver winner's [[August Belmont Trophy|trophy]], designed by [[Paulding Farnham]] for [[Tiffany and Co.]]  It was first presented to [[August Belmont Jr.]] in 1896 and donated by the Belmont family for annual presentation in 1926.\n\nDespite the fact that the Belmont Stakes is the oldest of the Triple Crown races, its traditions have been more subject to change. Until 1996, the post parade song was \"[[The Sidewalks of New York]]\". From 1997 to 2009, the song was changed to broadcast a recording by [[Frank Sinatra]] of the \"[[Theme from New York, New York]]\" in an attempt to appeal to younger fans.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://horseracing.about.com/od/belmontstakes/ss/aabeltraditions_4.htm |title=Belmont Stakes Traditions |publisher=Horseracing.about.com |date=2010-06-15 |accessdate=2010-10-07}}</ref> In 2010, the song was changed to [[Jay-Z]]'s \"[[Empire State of Mind]]\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.newsobserver.com/2010/06/04/514149/the-belmont-stakes-singing-a-new.html|title=The Belmont Stakes singing a new tune|author=The Associated Press|date=June 4, 2010|publisher=newsobserver.com|accessdate=June 19, 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121029151624/http://www.newsobserver.com/2010/06/04/514149/the-belmont-stakes-singing-a-new.html|archivedate=October 29, 2012|df=}}</ref> before reverting to \"Theme from ''New York, New York''\" from 2011<ref>{{cite web|url=http://articles.boston.com/2011-06-04/ae/29685780_1_nyra-belmont-stakes-horses-step|archive-url=https://archive.is/20130118082742/http://articles.boston.com/2011-06-04/ae/29685780_1_nyra-belmont-stakes-horses-step|dead-url=yes|archive-date=January 18, 2013|title=Sinatra's voice returns to Belmont Stakes|author=The Associated Press|date=June 4, 2011|publisher=boston.com|accessdate=June 19, 2012}}</ref> through the present.

Petty tried to turn under Pearson coming off the final corner, but didn't clear Pearson. The contact caused the drivers to spin into the grass in the infield just short of the finish line. Petty's car didn't start, but Pearson was able to keep his car running and limp over the finish line for the win. Many fans consider this finish to be the greatest in the history of NASCAR.\n*'''[[1979 Daytona 500|1979]]''': The 1979 race was the first Daytona 500 to be broadcast live on national television,<ref name=nascar.com>{{cite web|url=http://www.nascar.com/2003/kyn/history/daytona/01/23/daytona_1979/ |title=1979: Petty winds up in 'fist' place |accessdate=June 9, 2007 |author=Mark Aumann |date=January 23, 2003 |publisher=Turner Sports Interactive |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110525061914/http://www.nascar.com/2003/kyn/history/daytona/01/23/daytona_1979/ |archivedate=May 25, 2011 |df= }}</ref><ref name=amazon>{{cite web |url=https://www.amazon.com/1979-Daytona-500/dp/B000E4IED2 |title=1979 Daytona 500 |accessdate=June 9, 2007 |publisher=Amazon.com| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20070716050023/http://www.amazon.com/1979-Daytona-500/dp/B000E4IED2| archivedate= 16 July 2007 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= yes}}</ref> airing on [[CBS Sports|CBS]], whose audience was increased in much of the Eastern and Midwestern USA due to a blizzard. (The [[Indianapolis 500]] was only broadcast on tape delay that evening in this era; most races were broadcast only through the final quarter to half of the race, as was the procedure for ABC's Championship Auto Racing broadcasts; with the new CBS contract, the network and NASCAR agreed to a full live broadcast.) That telecast introduced in-car and low-level track-side cameras, which has now become standard in all sorts of automotive racing broadcasts. A final lap crash and subsequent fight between leaders Cale Yarborough and [[Donnie Allison]] (along with Donnie's brother [[Bobby Allison|Bobby]]) brought national (if unwelcome) publicity to NASCAR, with the added emphasis of a snowstorm that bogged down much of the northeastern part of the United States. Donnie Allison was leading the race on the final lap with Yarborough drafting him tightly. As Yarborough attempted a slingshot pass at the end of the backstretch, Allison attempted to block him. Yarborough refused to give ground and as he pulled alongside Allison, his left side tires left the pavement and went into the wet and muddy infield grass. Yarborough lost control of his car and contacted Allison's car halfway down the backstretch. As both drivers tried to regain control, their cars made contact several more times before finally locking together and crashing into the outside wall in turn three. After the cars settled in the grass, Donnie Allison and Yarborough began to argue. After they had talked it out, Bobby Allison, who was lapped at that point, pulled over, began defending his brother, and a fight broke out. Richard Petty, who was over half a lap behind at the time, went on to win; with the brawl in the infield, the television audience scarcely noticed. The story was the talk of the water cooler the next day, even making the front page of ''[[The New York Times]]'' Sports section.\n*'''[[1980 Daytona 500|1980]]''': [[Buddy Baker]] won the fastest Daytona 500 in history, at 177.602&nbsp;mph (285.809&nbsp;km/h).\n*'''[[1981 Daytona 500|1981]]''': Richard Petty becomes the first seven-time winner, three wins more than the second highest multiple winner, Cale Yarborough.

He joined Richard Petty as the only drivers to win the race in consecutive years and to win the race four times overall.\n*'''[[1985 Daytona 500|1985]]''': [[Bill Elliott]] dominated the race, and by lap 140, was close to lapping the entire field. During a pit stop, NASCAR officials held him in the pit area in order to repair a supposed broken headlight assembly. The two-minute pit stop dropped him to third, barely clinging to the lead lap. Elliott made up the deficit and survived a late race caution and a final lap restart to win his first Daytona 500. Elliott would go on to win the first [[Grand Slam (NASCAR)|Winston Million]].\n*'''[[1986 Daytona 500|1986]]''': The race that came down to a two-car duel between  [[Dale Earnhardt]] and [[Geoff Bodine]]. With 3 laps to go, Earnhardt was forced to make a pit stop for a \"splash 'n go\". However, as Earnhardt left the pits, he burned a piston, allowing Bodine to cruise to victory.\n*'''[[1987 Daytona 500|1987]]''': Winner Bill Elliott qualified for the pole position at an all-time Daytona record of 210.364&nbsp;mph (338.532&nbsp;km/h)..\n*'''[[1988 Daytona 500|1988]]''': [[Restrictor plate]]s were mandated to reduce dangerously high speeds at Daytona. [[Bobby Allison]] and his son [[Davey Allison|Davey]] finished one-two and celebrated together in Victory Lane, making Bobby Allison the oldest driver to win the Daytona 500.\n*'''[[1990 Daytona 500|1990]]''': Dale Earnhardt appeared headed for certain victory until the closing laps. On lap 193, Geoff Bodine spun in the first turn, causing the third and final caution of the race. All of the leaders pitted except [[Derrike Cope]], who stayed out to gain track position. On the lap 195 restart, Earnhardt re-took the lead. On the final lap, going into turn three, he ran over a [[bell housing]] from the blown engine of [[Rick Wilson (NASCAR)|Rick Wilson]]'s car. He blew a tire, allowing the relatively unknown Cope to slip by and take the his first career win in a major upset.<ref>{{cite web | title = NASCAR.com&nbsp;— The 1990 Daytona 500 - July 28, 2003 | url = http://www.nascar.com/2002/kyn/history/races/02/02/90daytona500/ | accessdate = 2008-02-20 | year = 2008 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070817224950/http://www.nascar.com/2002/kyn/history/races/02/02/90daytona500/ | archivedate = August 17, 2007 | df =  }}</ref>\n*'''[[1991 Daytona 500|1991]]''': Dale Earnhardt's Daytona 500 frustrations continued as [[Ernie Irvan]] passed Earnhardt with six laps to go to.

The race was dominated by complex pit stop rules, implemented to improve safety in the pit area.\n*'''[[1992 Daytona 500|1992]]''': Davey Allison dominated the second half en route to his lone Daytona 500 victory. He avoided a major wreck on lap 92 and went on to lead the final 102 laps.\n*'''[[1993 Daytona 500|1993]]''':  On lap 170, a frightening wreck saw [[Rusty Wallace]] flip over multiple times on the back straightaway. With two laps to go, [[Dale Earnhardt]] was leading Jeff Gordon and [[Dale Jarrett]]. Jarrett battled into the lead with one lap to go. It was the fourth time Earnhardt had been leading the Daytona 500 with less than ten laps to go, but failed to win.\n*'''[[1994 Daytona 500|1994]]''': [[Sterling Marlin]] gambled on fuel, and was able to complete the final 59 laps without stopping, to win his first career Cup victory.  During Speedweeks, two drivers died, Neil Bonnett and Rodney Orr.\n*'''[[1995 Daytona 500|1995]]''': Sterling Marlin became the first driver since Cale Yarborough, and only third overall, to win back-to-back Daytona 500s. To date, Marlin is the last driver to have won back-to-back Daytona 500s. It was the third win in five years for [[Morgan–McClure Motorsports]] (1991, 1994, 1995).\n*'''[[1996 Daytona 500|1996]]''': Dale Jarrett won his second Daytona 500 in four years, again holding off Dale Earnhardt, who finished second for the third time in four years.\n*'''[[1997 Daytona 500|1997]]''': Jeff Gordon became the youngest driver to win the Daytona 500.\n*'''[[1998 Daytona 500|1998]]''': Dale Earnhardt finally won the Daytona 500 after 20 years of trying. Though Earnhardt had usually been a strong competitor in the Daytona 500, mechanical problems, crashes, or other misfortunes had prevented him from winning. After his victory, a joyous Earnhardt drove slowly down pit road, where members of other race teams had lined up to give him handshakes and high-fives. [[Mike Joy]], who was play-by-play announcer for [[NASCAR on CBS|CBS]]'s broadcast, called the win \"the most anticipated moment in racing\".{{citation needed|date=October 2015}}\n*'''[[2001 Daytona 500|2001]]''': Also known as '''\"Black Sunday\"''', or the \"darkest day in NASCAR\", as Dale Earnhardt [[Death of Dale Earnhardt|died in a crash]] on the final lap.

Dale Earnhardt Jr.  finished second.\n*'''[[2011 Daytona 500|2011]]''': Since this race marked the tenth anniversary of the death of Dale Earnhardt, the third lap was a \"silent lap\", meaning the TV and radio announcers were silent during the entire lap, and fans held up three fingers in reference to Earnhardt's car number. [[Trevor Bayne]], at 20 years and one day old, became the youngest Daytona 500 winner ever.\n*'''[[2012 Daytona 500|2012]]''': While 2010 was the longest distance, 2012 was the longest time to complete the race. Scheduled for a 12 noon EST start on Sunday, rain delayed the race to Monday, then further delayed it to a 7 PM start that Monday night, resulting in the first primetime Daytona 500 start (but the third to reach primetime). On lap 160, [[Juan Pablo Montoya]] crashed into a jet dryer in turn 3, sparking a lengthy red flag as crews put out the resulting fire and repaired the damage. The race finally ended at approximately 1 AM EST Tuesday morning, 37 hours after the originally scheduled start, with [[Matt Kenseth]] becoming the first repeat winner since [[Jeff Gordon]] who won the [[2005 Daytona 500|2005]] race.\n*'''[[2013 Daytona 500|2013]]''': This race saw a number of firsts.

She also was the first woman to lead laps under green flag conditions in the race. [[Jimmie Johnson]] earned his second Daytona 500 victory.\n*'''[[2014 Daytona 500|2014]]''': For the second year in a row, a rookie won the pole position, in this case [[Austin Dillon]] in his first ride in the newly renumbered #3 Chevy SS for Richard Childress Racing, the first time the #3 had been used in a NASCAR Cup Series race since Dale Earnhardt's death. Dale Earnhardt, Jr., won his second Daytona 500, the third straight won by a past winner, after Kenseth in 2012 and Johnson in 2013.

The second major crash happened when [[Jimmie Johnson]] spun around and collected [[Trevor Bayne]] and 14 more cars. with four laps to go Elliott ran out of fuel and gave up the lead to [[Martin Truex Jr.]], with two laps to go Truex also ran out of gas and [[Kyle  Larson]] took the lead but the same fate fell on Larson and [[Kurt Busch]] took the lead in Turn 2 on the final lap to win the 59th Daytona 500.\n*'''[[2018 Daytona 500|2018]]''': 20 years after [[Dale Earnhardt Sr.]] earned his [[1998 Daytona 500|iconic victory]] at Daytona, [[Austin Dillon]] brought Richard Childress's #3 Chevrolet back to Victory Lane. Dillon, Childress's grandson who was photographed next to Earnhardt as a child after the earlier win, led only the final lap, bumping leader [[Aric Almirola]] out of the way, sending the latter's Ford into the wall. Also of note, rookie [[Darrell Wallace Jr.]] finished in the runner-up spot, barely edging out 2016 winner [[Denny Hamlin]], the highest finish for an African-American driver in the event's history. It was also the final NASCAR race for [[Danica Patrick]], who was collected in a multi-car wreck near the end of the second stage that also ended the days of [[Chase Elliott]], [[Brad Keselowski]], [[Kevin Harvick]], among others.\n\n==Qualifying procedure==\n{{main article|Can-Am Duel}}\nThe qualifying procedure is unique for the Daytona 500. Some teams must race their way into the Daytona 500 field. The first row is set by a timed round of qualifying, held one week before the race (prior to 2003, this was two rounds; prior to 2001, it was three). The remainder of the field is set by two separate qualifying races (these were {{convert|100|mi|km}} from 1959 to 1967; {{convert|125|mi|km}} from 1969 to 2004; and {{convert|150|mi|km}} with two lap overtime, if necessary, beginning in 2005 (these races were not held in 1968 due to rain). The top two drivers from the qualifying races who were not in the top 35 in owner points were given spots on the field, and the rest of the field was set by the finishing order of the duels, with guaranteed spots to those in the top 35. The remaining spots, 40 to 43, were filled by top qualifying times of those not already in the field from the qualifying race. If there was a previous NASCAR champion without a spot, he would get one of those four spots, otherwise, the fourth fastest car was added to the field.\n\nPrior to 2005 – and beginning again in 2013 – after the top two cars were set, the top fourteen cars in the qualifying races advance to the field, and then between six (1998–2003), eight (1995–97, 2004) or 10 (until 1994) fastest cars which do not advance from the qualifying race are added, then cars in the top 35 in owner points not locked into the race, and then the driver with the championship provisional, except for 1985 when no such car was eligible for a provisional starting spot, the only time that happened in the Daytona 500 from when the provisional was added in 1976 through 2004.\n\n==Television==\n{{see also|List of Daytona 500 broadcasters}}\n\nThe Daytona 500 was the first {{convert|500|mi|km|sing=on}} auto race to be televised live flag-to-flag on network television when [[CBS]] aired it in 1979, continuing to air until 2000.\n\nFrom 2001 to 2006, the race alternated between [[Fox NASCAR|FOX]] and [[NASCAR on NBC|NBC]] under the terms of a six–year, $2.48 billion NASCAR television contract, with FOX broadcasting the Daytona 500 in odd-numbered years (2001, 2003, 2005) and the [[Coke Zero 400|Pepsi 400]] in even-numbered years (2002, 2004, 2006) and NBC broadcasting the opposite race in that year.\n\nIn 2005, a new television contract was signed, which made FOX the sole broadcaster of the Daytona 500 for eight years, from 2007 to 2014. In 2013, 10 more years were added to the contract, giving FOX every Daytona 500 from 2015 to 2024 as well, for a total of at least 20 Daytona 500s in a row.\nThe installation of the [[Night game#Motorsports|lighting system]] at Daytona International Speedway in 1998, as well as the implementations of the television packages in 2001 and 2007 respectively, have resulted in the race starting and ending much later than it did in the race's early years. The race started at 12:15&nbsp;p.m. [[Eastern Time Zone|EST]] from 1979 until 2000. The start time was moved to 1:00&nbsp;p.m. Eastern time from 2001 to 2004, 2:30&nbsp;p.m. in 2005 and 2006 and 3:30&nbsp;p.m. from 2007 to 2009, all for the convenience of west coast viewers. The 2005 race ended at sunset for the first time in its history, and the 2006 race ended well after sunset.\n\nEvery Daytona 500 between 2006 and 2010, as well as the 2012 and 2014 races, ended under the lights. The changing track conditions caused by the onset of darkness in the closing laps in these years forced the crew chiefs to predict the critical car setup adjustments needed for their final two pit stops. The 2007 race was the first Daytona 500 to go into prime-time, ending at 7:07&nbsp;p.m. Eastern time. In 2010, the race moved back to a 1:00&nbsp;p.m. start time, which should have resulted in it ending in daylight; however, two red flags caused by track surface issues led to long delays that pushed the race to 7:34&nbsp;p.m. EST, pushing the race into prime-time for the second time. The 2012 race was also scheduled to start at 1:00&nbsp;p.m. EST on Sunday, February 26, but heavy rain in the area caused the race to be postponed to 7:00&nbsp;p.m. EST on Monday, February 27, making it the first Daytona 500 to be postponed to a Monday, as well as the first (and only) Daytona 500 to be run as a night race. Due to a two–hour red flag period after a jet dryer fire on the track with 40 laps remaining, the race did not end until about 12:40&nbsp;a.m. on Tuesday, February 28. The 2013 race marked a return to the race's past tradition of ending in the late afternoon, as it ended at about 4:40&nbsp;p.m., the race's earliest ending time since 2004. Although the 2014 race started around 1:30&nbsp;p.m. EST, heavy rain and a [[tornado warning]] red–flagged the race after 38 laps and it was delayed for a record six hours and 22 minutes; the race finished the entire 500–mile distance around after 11:00&nbsp;p.m. the same day, which effectively competed with the time delayed East Coast broadcast of [[Olympics on NBC|NBC]]'s coverage of the [[2014 Winter Olympics]] [[2014 Winter Olympics closing ceremony|closing ceremony]], scheduled between 7:00 and 10:30&nbsp;p.m. The 2015 race started on time around 1:00 &nbsp;p.m., and ended after 203 laps due to a Green–white–checkered finish.\n\nThe television ratings for the Daytona 500 have surpassed those of the larger [[Indianapolis 500]] (which has much larger physical attendance and international attendance) since 1995, even though the 1995 race was available in far fewer homes than the year before. Then-broadcaster CBS had lost well-established [[very high frequency|VHF]] (channels 2–13) affiliates in major markets as a result of the [[1994 United States broadcast TV realignment|Fox affiliate switches of 1994]]. As an example, new affiliates [[WDJT-TV|WDJT]] in [[Milwaukee]] and [[WGCL-TV|WGNX]] in [[Atlanta]]&nbsp;— both cities that are home to NASCAR races&nbsp;—  and [[WWJ-TV|WWJ]] in [[Detroit]], close to [[Michigan International Speedway]], were on the [[ultra high frequency|UHF]] band (channels 14–69), meaning that they had a significantly reduced broadcast area compared to former affiliates [[WITI (TV)|WITI]], [[WAGA-TV]], and [[WJBK]], respectively.

The service included the company's [[Wii Shop Channel]] and [[DSi Shop]] game download services, the former of which still works as of 2017. It also ran features for the [[Wii]] and [[Nintendo DS]] systems.\n\nGames designed to take advantage of Nintendo Wi-Fi Connection offered Internet play integrated into the game. When promoting this service, Nintendo emphasized the simplicity and speed of starting an online game. For example, in ''[[Mario Kart DS]]'', an online game was initiated by selecting the online multiplayer option from the main menu, then choosing whether to play with friends, or to play with other gamers (either in the local region or worldwide) at about the same skill level. After a selection was made, the game started searching for an available player.\n\nOn January 26, 2012, it was announced by Nintendo during an investors' meeting that the Nintendo Wi-Fi Connection service will be succeeded by and absorbed into '''[[Nintendo Network]]'''.  This new online system will eventually unify the 3DS and Wii U platforms and replace Friend Codes, while providing paid downloadable content, an online community style multiplayer system, and personal accounts. Nintendo Network is fully supported on the [[Nintendo 3DS]] and on the [[Wii U]], whilst still continuing providing partial legacy support for both Wii and Nintendo DS under the Nintendo Wi-Fi Connection brand.  Specifically, the Wii U can boot to Wii mode and then access the [[List of messaging applications for Nintendo game consoles#Wii Message Board|Wii Message Board]] messages which have been recorded by the gameplay progress of compatible local games, but it cannot send Wii Message Board messages remotely between different machines.\n\nThe Nintendo Wi-Fi Connection service was terminated on May 20, 2014 at 10.30 PM (EST) for all [[Nintendo Wii|Wii]] and [[Nintendo DS|DS]] games; online play features incorporated into these games are no longer available without hacking. The shutdown is connected to the shutdown of multiplayer services by [[GameSpy]], who was acquired by [[Glu Mobile]] in 2012. 3DS and Wii U games are not affected by the shutdown because their multiplayer platform uses Nintendo's own infrastructure instead of a third-party service. The Wii Shop Channel, third-party video services, and the Pay & Play variants will remain active for the moment.<ref name=ign-nintendoterminate>{{cite web|title=Nintendo Terminating Wi-fi Service For DS and Wii|url=http://ca.ign.com/articles/2014/02/27/nintendo-terminating-wi-fi-service-for-ds-and-wii|publisher=[[IGN]]|accessdate=April 4, 2014}}</ref><ref name=ign-gamespyshutdown>{{cite web|title=GameSpy Multiplayer Shutting Down, Hundreds of Games at Risk|url=http://ca.ign.com/articles/2014/04/03/gamespy-multiplayer-shutting-down-hundreds-of-games-at-risk|work=IGN|accessdate=April 4, 2014}}</ref>\n\nThe shutdown had an immediate effect on all Nintendo-published Wii and Nintendo DS titles, however it may not necessarily apply to certain third-party titles, which could have separate servers running their own games' online functions. For example, [[Electronic Arts]] revealed that some of the games they published on the Wii and Nintendo DS had their online support terminated on June 30, 2014.<ref name=NL-EAterminate>{{cite web |title=EA Releases Lengthy List of Online Services to be Shut Down on DS and Wii |url=http://www.nintendolife.com/news/2014/05/ea_releases_lengthy_list_of_online_services_to_be_shut_down_on_ds_and_wii |first=Thomas |last=Whitehead |publisher=Nintendo Life |date= May 12, 2014|accessdate=May 13, 2014}}</ref>\n\nA small selection of online-enabled Wii games, such as newer ''FIFA'' games as well as ''[[Call of Duty]]'' games (except ''[[Call of Duty: World at War|World at War]]'') and ''[[Dragon Quest X]]'', which by happenstance are not branded under the Nintendo Wi-Fi Connection, may continue using their online functions normally. Starting in 2015, various [[List of Wii games on Wii U eShop|Wii]] and Nintendo DS titles were digitally re-released, including titles which formerly supported Nintendo Wi-Fi Connection. However, like their physical counterparts post shutdown date, the digital versions are only playable offline, despite faithfully retaining online features.\n\n==Launch==\nOn November 14, 2005, the Nintendo Wi-Fi Connection was deployed, having been developed under the direct supervision of company president Satoru Iwata. Nintendo's Takao Ohara lamented that Nintendo's long history of online strategies had each quit due to unexpectedly insufficient userbases, but that the Wi-Fi Connection had in four months garnered 2.9 million connections from over one million unique users. To achieve the goal of a truly sustainable online userbase with the most-used network service in the world, Ohara described a new strategy of identifying and relieving four main barriers. The proposed four barriers are difficult setup procedures, the psychological barrier preventing newcomers from joining in games, the unpleasantness of receiving abuse from other players, and the cost barrier. The company's proposed online strategy at this point was called \"simple, safe, free\". Nintendo believed that the online platform's success directly propelled the commercial success of the entire Nintendo DS platform. The Nintendo Wi-Fi Connection then served as part of the basis of what would become the Wii.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.famitsu.com/game/news/2006/03/25/103,1143298259,50588,0,0.html|title=Wi-Fiコネクションについて講演　『ウイイレ』など40タイトルが開発中  - ファミ通|last=|first=|date=March 28, 2006|website=Famitsu|language=ja|others=[http://famitsu.blogspot.com/2006/03/zen-of-wi-fi.html Translation]|access-date=April 23, 2017}}</ref>\n\n== Nintendo Wi-Fi Connection architecture ==\n{| class=wikitable \n|-\n!

Games designed to take advantage of Nintendo Wi-Fi Connection offered Internet play integrated into the game. The Nintendo Wi-Fi Connection supported up to sixteen players on the Nintendo DS and thirty-two players on the Wii. Basic features of the Wi-Fi Connection included worldwide matchmaking, leaderboards, tournaments. Additional features were available between friends who exchanged Friend Codes.\n\n===Friend Codes===\nEach game that used the Nintendo Wi-Fi Connection generated a unique twelve-digit Friend Code that could be exchanged with friends and be used to maintain individual friend lists in each game. Though certain games could be played online without a Friend Code, a Friend Code was required to play with a specific person. Friend Codes were generated from an identifier unique to a copy of a game and the Nintendo Wi-Fi Connection ID of a DS or Wii system. Using a different copy of a game or loading the same copy in a different system generated a new Friend Code.<ref name=\"friend codes\">{{cite web|publisher=Nintendo|title=&#124; Nintendo - Customer Service &#124; Nintendo Wi-Fi connection - Friend Codes|accessdate=October 11, 2012|url=https://www.nintendo.com/consumer/wfc/en_na/ds/gameSupportFriendCodes.jsp}}</ref>  If users wanted to become \"Friends\", they had to mutually add Friend Codes and be authenticated as Friends once both of them were online. Nintendo introduced these features as conscious steps to preserve users' privacy. If a DS or Wii game was sold, but not the system, there was no risk of the purchaser impersonating the seller. If a user needed to replace his or her DS system, then the old system's Nintendo Wi-Fi Connection ID could be transferred wirelessly, in order to maintain the user's original Friend Codes on the new machine. Some games required that the user had to use Friend Codes to use any online functionality.\n\nMany games have additional features that are enabled between registered friends. These may include customized matchmaking options, cooperative play, friend lists, text chat, and voice chat. [[List of Wii games using WiiConnect24|Certain Wii games]] use the 16-digit Wii Number to share some data passively between mutually registered users via [[WiiConnect24]] instead of using independent Friend Codes. Although, some of these games may use both the 16-digit Wii Number and its own 12-digit Friend Code, depending on whether the online connectivity requires either passive data-sharing or active multiplaying respectively.\n\n===Pay & Play===\nIn 2008, Nintendo announced a new feature for the Wi-Fi Connection called Pay & Play. Games that use the Pay & Play feature may have additional [[downloadable content]] (DLC) or services that require extra fees. These fees will be paid for using [[Nintendo Points]]. A special red Wi-Fi Connection logo with the words \"Pay & Play\" is used to distinguish these games from the regular free Wi-Fi games.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://wii.ign.com/articles/854/854251p1.html |title=IGN: GDC 2008: Pay & Play Your Wii |author=Daemon Hatfield |publisher=IGN |date=February 22, 2008}}</ref>\n\nThe first games to feature Pay & Play were released in Japan as part of [[WiiWare]] on the March 25, 2008.

WiiConnect24 was a feature of Wii that allowed the system to be connected to the Internet even when the console was in standby mode. Games and channels that utilized WiiConnect24 could send and receive data even while the game was not being played. Players who wished to send data to friends only needed to register each other's Wii System Code and not individual Friend Codes.  Players could also send messages to their friends using WiiConnect24 from the Wii Message Board.  When a message was received, the Wii's slot light glowed blue. WiiConnect24 is succeeded by [[StreetPass and SpotPass#SpotPass|SpotPass]] for newer Nintendo consoles.\n\n===BBC iPlayer===\nOn April 9, 2008, the [[BBC]] announced that its online [[BBC iPlayer]] would be available on the Wii via the [[Internet Channel]] browser. Some users experienced difficulties with the service.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.techradar.com/news/internet/bbc-re-launches-iplayer-on-wii-to-fix-problems-650149|title=BBC re-launches iPlayer on Wii to fix problems|newspaper=TechRadar|access-date=October 24, 2016}}</ref> On November 18, 2009, [[BBC iPlayer]] on the Wii was relaunched as the BBC iPlayer Channel,<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/8357777.stm|title=BBC iPlayer launches Wii channel|publisher=BBC|accessdate=December 26, 2009 | date=November 13, 2009}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/blogs/bbcinternet/2009/11/the_new_iplayer_on_the_nintend.html|title=The new iPlayer on the Nintendo Wii|publisher=BBC|accessdate=December 26, 2009}}</ref> which is free to download from the [[Wii Shop Channel]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://iplayerhelp.external.bbc.co.uk/help/playing_tv_progs/nintendo_Wii|title=Can I access BBC iPlayer on my Nintendo Wii game system?|publisher=BBC|accessdate=September 27, 2010}}</ref> The service was only available to users in the [[United Kingdom]].

Users can browse in the [[Virtual Console]], [[WiiWare]], or [[Wii Menu|Wii Channels]] sections for downloads. A feature to purchase downloaded software as gifts for others became available worldwide on December 10, 2007. Additional channels that were not released at the console's launch are available for purchase in the Wii Shop Channel. These include: [[Internet Channel]], [[Everybody Votes Channel]], [[Check Mii Out Channel]], [[Nintendo Channel]], [[Netflix|Netflix Channel]], [[Hulu|Hulu Plus Channel]] and the Japan-only [[Television Friend Channel]]. Currently all downloadable channels are free of charge. Nintendo announced the purchase and redemption of [[Wii Points]] would be disabled on March 26, 2018, and then shut down the channel on January 30, 2019.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.polygon.com/2017/9/29/16386918/wii-shop-channel-closing-nintendo|title=Wii Shop Channel closing down in 2019|first=Ashley|last=Oh|date=September 29, 2017|website=Polygon}}</ref>\n\n===Virtual Console Channels===\n{{Main article|Virtual Console}}\n''Virtual Console'' channels are channels that allow users to play their downloaded ''Virtual Console'' games obtained from the Wii Shop Channel. The ''Virtual Console'' portion of the Wii Shop Channel specializes in older software originally designed and released for home entertainment platforms that are now defunct. These games are played on the Wii through the [[Video game console emulator|emulation]] of the older hardware. The prices are generally the same in almost every region and are determined primarily by the software's original platform.\n\n===WiiWare Channels===\n{{Main article|WiiWare}}\nFunctioning similarly to the ''Virtual Console'' channels, ''WiiWare'' channels allow users to use their WiiWare games obtained from the Wii Shop Channel. The WiiWare section specializes in downloadable software specifically designed for the Wii. The first WiiWare games were made available on March 25, 2008 in Japan.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gamespot.com/news/6187517.html?action=convert&om_clk=latestnews&tag=latestnews;title;1|title=WiiWare launching in Japan March 25|work=GameSpot|accessdate=February 7, 2015}}</ref> WiiWare games launched in North America on May 12, 2008,<ref>{{cite news |author= |title=UPDATE 1-Nintendo rolls out Wii fitness game product |date=February 20, 2008 |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSN2034720820080220 |accessdate=February 21, 2008 | work=Reuters | first=Yinka | last=Adegoke}}</ref> and launched in Europe and Australia on May 20, 2008.<ref>{{cite web |author=Nintendo of Europe |title=Nintendo announces Q2 release schedule |date=April 24, 2008 |url=https://www.nintendo.co.uk/NOE/en_GB/news/2008/nintendo_announces_q2_release_schedule_7920.html |accessdate=April 24, 2008}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ign.com/articles/2008/05/20/wiiware-launches-in-australia|title=WiiWare Launches in Australia|publisher=IGN|date=May 19, 2008}}</ref>\n\nThe WiiWare section is being touted as a forum to provide developers with small budgets to release smaller-scale games without the investment and risk of creating a title to be sold at retail (somewhat similar to the [[Xbox Live Arcade]] and the [[PlayStation Store]]). While actual games have been planned to appear in this section since its inception, there had been no official word on when any would be appearing until June 27, 2007, when Nintendo made an official confirmation in a press release which revealed the first titles would surface sometime in 2008. According to Nintendo, \"The remarkable motion controls will give birth to fresh takes on established genres, as well as original ideas that currently exist only in developers' minds.\"\n\nLike Virtual Console games, WiiWare games are purchased using Wii Points. Nintendo handles all pricing options for the downloadable games.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.nintendo.com/whatsnew/detail/lJUgYjCGf4pVbYMAU2qmwF3wp7DiOK5k |title=Nintendo's WiiWare Paves the Way for Fresh Games, Cool Consumer Experiences |date=June 27, 2007 |publisher=Nintendo of America |accessdate=December 15, 2009}}</ref>\n\n===Nintendo DSi Shop===\nThe Nintendo DSi shop is an online store for the [[Nintendo DSi]] and [[Nintendo DSi XL]] systems, where people can download DSiWare games and applications. Nintendo announced the Nintendo DSi Shop is officially shutting down on March 31, 2017, after disabling the purchase of additional [[Nintendo Points|Nintendo DSi Points]] on September 30, 2016.

It has been discontinued.\n\n===Netflix===\nThe Nintendo Wii received Netflix on March 27, 2010 only for American and Canadian owners but a [[Netflix]] disc was required. As of October 18, 2010 American and Canadian Wii owners could watch [[Netflix]] instantly as a channel without requiring a disc.<ref name=Netflix>{{cite web|last=Hardawar|first=Devindra|date=October 18, 2010|title=Netflix streaming video now disc-free on the Nintendo Wii|url=https://venturebeat.com/2010/10/18/netflix-streaming-video-now-disc-free-on-the-nintendo-wii/|publisher=[[Netflix]]|accessdate=January 22, 2012}}</ref>\n\n===Internet Browser===\nThe Nintendo Wii, DS and DSi can surf the Internet with a downloadable browser. The Nintendo Wii and DSi browsers are powered by Opera, but the Nintendo 3DS browser is powered by [[NetFront]]. The Nintendo DS's web browser, also powered by Opera, requires a DS card and a RAM expansion through the [[Game Boy Advance]] port.\n\n===Forecast Channel===\nThe ''Forecast Channel'' first became available on December 19, 2006, and was shut down on June 28, 2013, due to the discontinuation of [[WiiConnect24]], which it required. The ''Forecast Channel'' allowed weather reports and forecasts to be shown on the console from the Internet via the WiiConnect24 service. The ''Forecast Channel'' displayed a view of the Earth as a user-spinnable globe (courtesy of [[NASA]]), with which users could view weather in other regions. When fully zoomed out, an accurate<ref name=\"star map accuracy\">{{cite web|url=http://us.wii.com/story_home.jsp |title=Us.Wii.com -- The Global Wii Experience Website in English |publisher=Nintendo |accessdate=April 13, 2007 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070403211244/http://us.wii.com/story_home.jsp |archivedate=April 3, 2007 }}</ref> star map was visible in the background.

The application allowed Wii owners to vote on various questions using their [[Mii]] as a registered voter. Additionally, voters could also make predictions for the choice that would be the most popular overall after their own vote had been cast. Each Mii's voting and prediction record was tracked and voters could also view how their opinions compared to others. Whether the Mii was correct in its predictions or not, it was displayed on a statistics page, along with a counter of how many times that Mii voted. Up to six Miis could be registered to vote on the console. The channel was free to download. Each player could make a suggestion for a poll a day.\n''Everybody Votes Channel'' was shut down on June 28, 2013.<ref name=\"gameinformer.com\"/>\n\n===LOVEFiLM Channel===\nAs of December 4, 2012, a LOVEFiLM channel is available to download in the UK.\n\n===YouTube Channel===\nThe YouTube channel allows the user to view YouTube videos on the television screen and has the ability to sign into an existing YouTube account. The YouTube channel, which became available without warning, is currently only available in the North American and Australian versions of the Wii system, with the North American release on November 15, 2012, only three days before the Wii U was released in North America. Google plans to gradually make the channel available on Wii in other countries besides the aforementioned regions. The YouTube channel was initially categorized on the Wii Shop Channel as a \"WiiWare\" title by mistake, but this was later fixed when the Wii U Transfer Tool channel became available.\n\nThe YouTube Channel has been disconnected after June 30, 2017 due to Google terminating legacy support for all [[Adobe Flash Player|Flash]]-based YouTube apps on that date.\n\n===Check Mii Out Channel===\n{{main article|Check Mii Out Channel}}\nThe ''Check Mii Out Channel'' (also known as the ''Mii Contest Channel'' and the ''WatchMii Channel''), is a channel that allows players to share their Miis and enter them into popularity contests. It was first available on November 11, 2007. It is available free to download from the [[Wii Menu|Wii Channels]] section of the [[Wii Shop Channel]].\n\nUsers can post their own Miis in the Posting Plaza, or import other user-submitted Miis to their own personal Mii Parade. Each submitted Mii is assigned a 12-digit entry number to aid in searching. Submitted Miis are given 2 initials by their creator and a notable skill/talent to aid in sorting.\n\nIn the Contests section, players can submit their own Miis to compete in contests to best fit a certain description (e.g. [[Mario]] without his cap). After the time period for sending a Mii has expired, the user has the choice of voting for three Miis featured on the judging panel, with ten random Miis being shown at a time. Once the judging period is over, the results of the contest may be viewed. Their selection and/or submission's popularity in comparison to others is displayed, as well as the winning Mii and user.\n\nThe Check Mii Out Channel sends messages to the Wii Message Board concerning recent contests. Participants in certain contests can add their user and submitted Mii to a photo with a background related to the contest theme. This picture can then be sent to the Wii Message Board. Check Mii Out Channel was shut down on June 28, 2013.\n\n===Television Friend Channel===\nThe ''Television Friend Channel'' allows Wii users to check what programs are on the television. Content is provided by [[Guide Plus]].

The channel also featured a compatibility test that compared two Miis, and it also gave out \"lucky words\" that had to be interpreted by the user. The channel used Mii birthdate data, but users had to input a birth year whenever they were loaded onto the channel.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.siliconera.com/2008/12/02/hands-on-nintendos-fortune-telling-channel/|title=Hands On Nintendo's Fortune Telling Channel - Siliconera|work=Siliconera|accessdate=February 7, 2015}}</ref>\n\n===Wii My Room Channel===\n{{main article|Wii no Ma}}\nA video on-demand service channel was released in Japan on May 1, 2009, it was planned to be released in North America.The channel is a [[joint venture]] between Nintendo and Japanese advertising agency [[Dentsu]]. The channel's interface is built around a virtual living room, where up to 8 Miis can be registered and interact with each other. The virtual living room contains a TV which takes the viewer to the video list. Celebrity \"concierge\" Miis occasionally introduce special programming.\n\n===Demae Channel===\nA food delivery service channel was released in Japan on May 26, 2009.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nintendo.co.jp/wii/features/wii_channel.html|title=Wii Channels|publisher=[[Nintendo]]|accessdate=April 26, 2009|language=ja}}</ref> The channel is a joint venture between Nintendo and Japanese on-line food delivery portal service Demae-can.

A note is posted to the Wii Message Board containing what had been ordered and the total price. The food is then delivered to the address the Wii user has registered on the channel. It is only available in Japan.\n\n===Nintendo Channel===\nThe ''Nintendo Channel'' (also known as the '''Everybody's Nintendo Channel''' in Japan), is a WiiConnect24 Wii Channel for the Wii. It was launched in Japan on November 27, 2007,<ref name=\"EverybodysNintendo\">{{cite web|title=DS demos on your Wii in Japan|publisher=Club Skill|date=November 27, 2007|url=http://www.clubskill.com/article/4710|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071213205913/http://www.clubskill.com/article/4710|archivedate=December 13, 2007}}</ref> in North America on May 7, 2008,<ref>[http://www.nintendic.com/news/2293 Nintendic » Nintendo Channel dated for US, WiiWare integrated<!-- Bot generated title -->] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080425202732/http://www.nintendic.com/news/2293 |date=April 25, 2008 }}</ref> and in Europe and Australia on May 30, 2008,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://nintendo.co.uk/NOE/en_GB/news/2008/nintendo_announces_q2_release_schedule_7920.html |archive-url=https://archive.is/20120530115128/http://nintendo.co.uk/NOE/en_GB/news/2008/nintendo_announces_q2_release_schedule_7920.html |dead-url=yes |archive-date=May 30, 2012 |title=Nintendo announces Q2 release schedule |publisher=[[Nintendo]] |date=April 24, 2008 |accessdate=April 24, 2008 }}</ref> and was shut down on June 28, 2013. It allowed [[Wii]] users to watch videos such as interviews, trailers, commercials, and even download [[Game demo|demos]] for the [[Nintendo DS]]. In this capacity, the channel worked in a similar way to the [[DS Download Station]]. The channel provided games info pages and users could rate games that they had played. A search feature was also available to assist users in finding new games to try or buy. The channel had the ability to take the user directly into the Wii Shop Channel for buying the wanted game immediately. The Nintendo Channel is updated with different Nintendo DS demos and new videos every week; the actual day of the week varies across different international regions.\n\nAn updated version of the Nintendo Channel was released in Japan on July 15, 2009,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nintendo.co.jp/wii/features/minnano_nintendo_ch/index.html|title=みんなのニンテンドーチャンネル - Wii|website=www.nintendo.co.jp}}</ref> North America on September 14, 2009, and in Europe on December 15, 2009. The update introduces a new interface and additional features, options, and statistics for users to view. However, the European version is missing some of these new additional features, such as options for choosing video quality. In addition, a weekly show known as ''[[Nintendo Week]]'' began airing exclusively on the North American edition of the channel, while another weekly show ''Nintendo TV'', is available on the UK version of the channel.<ref>[http://www.computerandvideogames.com/article.php?id=249788 News: ONM launches Nintendo TV].

The channel can work without inserting the ''[[Mario Kart Wii]]'' disc into the console, but to compete in races and time trials the disc is required. The use of the Mario Kart Channel allows for a number of options. A ranking option lets players see their best Time Trial scores for each track and compare their results to those of their friends and other players worldwide, represented by their Miis. Players will have the option of racing against the random or selective ghosts, or improving their results gradually by taking on the ghosts of rivals, those with similar race times. Users have the option to submit these times for others around the world to view. Players can also manage and register friends using the channel and see if any of them are currently online.\n\nAnother feature of the channel are Tournaments, where Nintendo will, on a regular basis, invite players to challenges similar to the missions on ''[[Mario Kart DS]]''. Players are also able to compare their competition rankings with other players.<ref>[http://nintendo.co.uk/NOE/en_GB/news/2008/going_global_with_mario_kart_wii__7448.html Nintendo - News - Going global with Mario Kart Wii<!-- Bot generated title -->]{{dead link|date=September 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>\n\n==Wii Message Board==\nThe Message Board's online connectivity is now defunct, along with the shutdown of its foundational [[WiiConnect24]] service. It allowed users to leave messages for friends, family members, or other users on a calendar-based message board. Users could also use WiiConnect24 to trade messages and pictures with other Wii owners, conventional email accounts (email pictures to console, but not pictures to email), and mobile phones (through text messages). Each Wii had an individual wii.com email account containing the Wii Number. Prior to trading messages, it was necessary to add and approve contacts in the address book, although the person added would not get a notification of the request. The service also alerted all users of incoming game-related information.\n\nMessage Board was available for users to post messages that are available to other Wii users by usage of Wii Numbers with the now defunct [[WiiConnect24]]. In addition to writing text, players could also include images from an SD card in the body of messages, as well as attaching a [[Mii]] to the message. Announcements of software updates and video game news were posted by Nintendo. The Message Board could be used for posting memos for oneself or for family members without going online. These messages could then be put on any day of the calendar. The Wii Message Board could also be updated automatically by a real-time game like ''[[Animal Crossing: City Folk]]''.\n\n===Wii Speak===\nUsers with the [[Wii Speak]] peripheral were able to access the ''Wii Speak Channel''. Users could join one of four rooms (with no limit to the number of people in each room) to chat with others online. Each user is represented by their own [[Mii]], which lip-syncs to their words. In addition, users could also leave audio messages for other users by sending a message to their Wii Message Board. Users could also share photo [[slide show]]s and comment on them. The Wii Speak Channel became available in North America and Europe on December 5, 2008.\n\n== Unofficial Relaunch ==\nIn 2014, a [[Homebrew (video games)|homebrew]] group called Wiimmfi (a play on the original service name Nintendo Wi-Fi Connection) unofficially brought the service back online for both Nintendo DS and Wii at the moment. Some use of homebrew is needed to use the service again.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://wii.guide/riiconnect24-evc|title=RiiConnect24 - Everybody Votes Channel Install|last=RiiConnect24|website=Wii Guide|language=en-US|access-date=2017-12-02}}</ref>\n\n==Games==\n{{main article|List of Nintendo DS Wi-Fi Connection games|List of Wii Wi-Fi Connection games}}\nThe first Wi-Fi Connection games were ''[[Mario Kart DS]]'' and ''[[Tony Hawk's American Sk8land]]'' for the Nintendo DS, released on November 14, 2005 and November 16, 2005 respectively, followed by ''[[Animal Crossing: Wild World]]'' in Japan on November 23 and in North America on December 5. The first Wii Wi-Fi Connection games were released in 2006 in Japan and in 2007 overseas. In Japan and North America the first game was ''[[Pokémon Battle Revolution]]''. In Europe, Australia, and New Zealand the first game was ''[[Mario Strikers Charged]]''.\n\nCurrently, there are over 100 [[Wii]] games, 25 [[WiiWare]] games, 93 [[Nintendo DS]] games, and 4 [[List of DSiWare games and applications|Nintendo DSiWare]] games available worldwide that supported Nintendo Wi-Fi Connection.\n\nSince May 20, 2014 10:30 (EST) it is no longer possible to download additional content for games, as the Nintendo Wi-Fi Connection service was terminated on that date.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nintendo.co.uk/Support/Nintendo-DSi-XL-/Basic-setup-and-use/Termination-of-Nintendo-Wi-Fi-Connection/Titles-with-additional-downloadable-content/Titles-with-additional-downloadable-content-864190.html|title=Titles with additional downloadable content|publisher=[[Nintendo]]|accessdate=May 15, 2014}}</ref>\n\n==Connection options==\n===Nintendo DS===\nThe [[Nintendo DS]] has an [[IEEE 802.11 (legacy mode)|802.11]] wireless adapter built in allowing the DS to access the service via a compatible wireless network. Support for 802.11b clients must be offered by an access point for a DS to be able to connect to it. Public hotspots that use a [[captive portal]] can be accessed after login using the [[Nintendo DS & DSi Browser|Nintendo DS Browser]].\n\nPrior to the release of the [[Nintendo DSi]], neither consoles nor games could support security protocols more advanced than [[Wired Equivalent Privacy|WEP]]. Even after the Nintendo DSi's release, only online-enabled games made exclusively or enhanced for usage on this console iteration were able to support the Nintendo DSi's native online connection. This extended to the [[Nintendo 3DS]] as well, conditional the console's native online connection setting is the same as the Nintendo DSi, as other advanced settings were also unsupported.\n\n===Wii===\nThe Wii has an 802.11b/g wireless adapter built-in. Due to flaws in its implementation, however, it is only capable of working when the 802.11 (legacy mode) basic rates of 1 Mbit/s and 2 Mbit/s are advertised by an access point. This means that 802.11b support must be offered on an access point for a Wii to be able to connect to it.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://nostringsattachedshow.com/2012/01/18/nintendo-vs-cisco/ | title=Nintendo vs. Cisco | publisher=The No Strings Attached Show  | accessdate=April 5, 2014}}</ref> It is compatible with [[Wired Equivalent Privacy|WEP]], [[Wi-Fi Protected Access|WPA]] with TKIP or CCMP, and [[IEEE 802.11i-2004|WPA2]] with CCMP. The Wii is also [[AOSS]] compatible as of the 3.0 system update. The connection settings allows players to configure access to and save settings for up to three different networks. Connection settings can be detected automatically or entered manually. The Wii does not have an Ethernet port built in, but can be connected via wired LAN with a USB Ethernet adapter available from Nintendo and third parties.\n\n===Nintendo Wi-Fi USB Connector===\n[[File:Nintendo Wi-Fi USB Connector.jpg|thumb|The Nintendo Wi-Fi USB Connector|200px]]\nIf a compatible wireless network is not available, the Nintendo DS and Wii can also connect through the [[Nintendo Wi-Fi USB Connector]].

As of November 2008, the site has closed in North America and has now moved into a subsection of the Games section on Nintendo.com. On May 20, 2014, the Nintendo Wi-Fi Connection service was shut down, and because of that, Nintendo has deleted the subsection on its website prior to May 20, 2014.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nintendo.com/games/wifi|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140404151330/http://www.nintendo.com/games/wifi|dead-url=yes|archive-date=April 4, 2014|title=Nintendo - Wayback Machine|work=[[Wayback Machine]]|date=May 16, 2014|accessdate=February 9, 2017}}</ref>\n\n==Closing==\nOn May 20, 2014, 10.30 PM EST Nintendo had ended Nintendo Wi-Fi Connection (WFC) for all games (except for Nintendo Wi-Fi Connection pay and play branded games, Nintendo DSi Shop services and Nintendo Wii Shop Channel services, Nintendo Wii/DSi update servers, and the Connection test server).

Indirect capital costs are ''not'' included, such as for road, rail, or airport infrastructure, or for hotel upgrades or other business investment incurred in preparation for the Games but not directly related to staging the Games. The cost for Sydney 2000 compares with a cost of USD 4.6 billion for Rio 2016, USD 40-44 billion for Beijing 2008 and USD 51 billion for Sochi 2014, the most expensive Olympics in history.

A \"multiplier\" effect on broader economic development is not realised, as a simple \"multiplier\" analysis fails to capture is that resources have to be redirected from elsewhere: the building of a stadium is at the expense of other public works such as extensions to hospitals. Building sporting venues does not add to the aggregate stock of productive capital in the years following the Games: \"Equestrian centres, softball compounds and man-made rapids are not particularly useful beyond their immediate function.\"<ref>{{cite news|url=http://business.smh.com.au/no-medals-for-economic-benefits-of-the-games/20080411-25ks.html | title = No medals for economic benefits of the Games|last = Saulwick | first = Jacob| date = 12 April 2008|accessdate =16 April 2008|work=Business Day| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080516200545/http://business.smh.com.au/no-medals-for-economic-benefits-of-the-games/20080411-25ks.html| archivedate= 16 May 2008 | deadurl=no}}  The article is based largely on a recent study by James Giesecke and John Madden from the Centre of Policy Studies at Monash University.</ref>\nIn the years after the games, infrastructure issues have been of growing concern to citizens, especially those in the western suburbs of Sydney.

Among the pre-ceremony fixtures, host nation Australia lost 1–0 to [[Italy national football team|Italy]] at the [[Melbourne Cricket Ground]], which was the main stadium for the [[1956 Melbourne Olympics]].\n\n===Day 1–15 September===\n\n====Cultural display highlights====\n{{See also|2000 Summer Olympics opening ceremony}}\n[[File:2000 Summer Olympics opening ceremony 1.JPEG|thumb|right|The [[2000 Summer Olympics Opening Ceremony]] at [[Stadium Australia]], on 15 September 2000.]]\nThe opening ceremony began with a tribute to the Australian pastoral heritage of the [[Stockman (Australia)|Australian stockmen]] and the importance of the [[Australian Stock Horse|stock horse]] in Australia's heritage. It was produced and filmed by Sydney Olympic Broadcasting Organisation and the home nation broadcaster, [[Seven Network|Channel 7]].<ref>Commentary on the official DVD of the opening ceremony of the 2000 Summer Olympics</ref>  This was introduced by a lone rider, [[Steve Jefferys]], and his rearing [[Australian Stock Horse]] ''Ammo''. At the cracking of Jefferys' [[stock whip|stockwhip]], a further 120 riders entered the Stadium, their stock horses performing intricate steps, including forming the five [[Olympic Rings]], to a special Olympics version of the theme which [[Bruce Rowland]] had previously composed for the 1982 film ''[[The Man from Snowy River (1982 film)|The Man from Snowy River]]''.\n\nThe [[Advance Australia Fair|Australian National Anthem]] was sung, the first verse by [[Human Nature (band)|Human Nature]] and the second by [[Julie Anthony (singer)|Julie Anthony]].\n\nThe ceremony continued, showing many aspects of the land and its people:- the affinity of the mainly coastal-dwelling Australians with the sea that surrounds the \"Island Continent\". The [[Indigenous Australians|indigenous]] occupation of the land, the coming of the [[First Fleet]], the continued immigration from many nations and the rural industry on which the economy of the nation was built, including a display representing the harshness of rural life based on the paintings of Sir [[Sidney Nolan]]. Two memorable scenes were the representation of the \"Heart\" of the country by 200 [[Indigenous Australians|Aboriginal]] women from [[Central Australia]] who danced up ''\"the mighty spirit of God to protect the Games\"'' and the overwhelmingly noisy representation of the [[construction industry]] by hundreds of tap-dancing teenagers.\n\nBecause Bibi Salisachs (the wife of [[Juan Antonio Samaranch]], the IOC President) was seriously ill and not able to accompany her husband to the Olympics, former Australian Olympic Champion swimmer and member of the [[Parliament of New South Wales]], [[Dawn Fraser]], accompanied Samaranch during the Australian cultural display, explaining to him some of the cultural references that are unfamiliar to non-Australians.\n\n====Formal presentation====\nA record 199 nations entered the stadium, with a record 80 of them winning at least one medal. The only missing [[International Olympic Committee|IOC]] member was [[Afghanistan]] (banned due to the extremist rule of the [[Taliban]]'s oppression of women and its prohibition of sports<ref>[https://www.afghanistan-analysts.org/flash-from-the-past-afghans-shattered-2000-olympic-dreams-amended/] Afghanistan-Analysts. Retrieved on 19 April 2015.</ref>). The ceremony featured a unified entrance by the athletes of [[North Korea|North]] and [[South Korea]], using a specially designed [[Unification Flag|unification flag]]: a white background flag with a blue map of the [[Korean Peninsula]]. However, the two teams competed separately. Four athletes from [[East Timor]] also marched in the parade of nations as [[Individual Olympic Athletes]] and marched directly before the Host country. Although the country-to-be had no National Olympic Committee then, they were allowed to compete under the [[Olympic Flag]] with country code [[Individual Olympic Athletes at the 2000 Summer Olympics|IOA]]. The [[Governor-General of Australia|Governor-General]], [[William Deane|Sir William Deane]], opened the games.\n\nThe [[Olympic Flag]] was carried around the arena by eight former Australian Olympic champions: [[Bill Roycroft]], [[Murray Rose]], [[Liane Tooth]], [[Gillian Rolton]], [[Marjorie Jackson]], [[Lorraine Crapp]], [[Michael Wenden]] and [[Nick Green (rower)|Nick Green]]. During the raising of the Olympics Flag, the [[Olympic Hymn]] was sung by the Millennium Choir of the [[Greek Orthodox Archdiocese of Australia]] in Greek. Following this, [[Tina Arena]] sang a purpose-written pop song, ''The Flame''.<ref>[http://entertainment.time.com/2012/07/30/11-olympic-theme-songs-dissected/slide/tina-arena-flame-sydney-2000/ 11 Olympic Theme Songs, Dissected].

Former Australian Olympic champion [[Herb Elliott]] brought the Olympic Flame into the stadium. Then, celebrating 100 years of women's participation in the Olympic Games, former Australian women Olympic medalists: [[Betty Cuthbert]] and [[Raelene Boyle]], [[Dawn Fraser]], [[Shirley Strickland]] (later Shirley Strickland de la Hunty), [[Shane Gould]] and [[Debbie Flintoff-King]] brought the torch through the stadium, handing it over to [[Cathy Freeman]], who lit the flame in the cauldron within a circle of fire. The planned spectacular climax to the ceremony was delayed by the technical glitch of a computer switch which malfunctioned, causing the sequence to shut down by giving a false reading. This meant that the Olympic flame was suspended in mid-air for about four minutes, rather than immediately rising up a water-covered ramp to the top of the stadium. When the cause of the problem was discovered, the program was overridden and the cauldron continued its course, and the ceremony concluded with a spectacular fireworks display.<ref>Information given by [[Ric Birch]], Director of Ceremonies, during an interview at the end of the official DVD of the 2000 Summer Olympics Opening Ceremony</ref>\n\nDespite his record achievements as an Australian sprinter, [[Peter Norman]] was not invited chiefly because he had participated in an [[1968 Olympics Black Power salute|anti-racial protest]] during the awards ceremony for the 200m race in the 1968 Mexico City Olympic Games.<ref name=\"CourierMail_Hurst_2006\">{{cite news|url=http://www.news.com.au/couriermail/story/0,,20541398-10389,00.html |title=Peter Norman's Olympic statement |last=Hurst |first=Mike |date=7 October 2006 |publisher=[[The Courier-Mail]] |accessdate=17 January 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091119061605/http://www.news.com.au/couriermail/story/0%2C%2C20541398-10389%2C00.html |archivedate=19 November 2009 |df= }}</ref> The AOC disputes that he was snubbed, stating that no other former athletes were invited and that Norman was offered the same chance to buy tickets as other former athletes were.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.cnn.com/2012/08/21/world/asia/australia-norman-olympic-apology/|title=Apology urged for Australian Olympian in 1968 black power protest|first=Hilary|last=Whiteman|publisher=CNN|date=21 August 2012|accessdate=2 September 2015}}</ref> During the Sydney Olympics, a reporter from The [[Washington Post]] found only one reference to Norman – an image on the side of a house in [[Redfern, New South Wales|Redfern]] [a predominantly aboriginal area].<ref>Martin Flanagan.

Set in the surroundings of the [[Sydney Opera House]], [[Brigitte McMahon]] representing Switzerland swam, cycled and ran to the first gold medal in the sport, beating the favoured home athletes such as Michelie Jones who won silver. McMahon only passed Jones in sight of the finish line.\n\nThe first star of the Games was [[Ian Thorpe]]. The 17-year-old Australian first set a new world record in the 400 m freestyle final before competing in an exciting 4 × 100 m freestyle final. Swimming the last leg, Thorpe passed the leading Americans and arrived in a new world record time, two tenths of a second ahead of the Americans. In the same event for women, the Americans also broke the world record, finishing ahead of the Netherlands and Sweden.\n\nSamaranch had to leave for home, as his wife was severely ill. Upon arrival, his wife had already died. Samaranch returned to Sydney four days later. The Olympic flag was flown at half-staff during the period as a sign of respect to Samaranch's wife.\n\n===Day 3–17 September===\nCanadian [[Simon Whitfield]] sprinted away in the last 100 metres of the men's triathlon, becoming the inaugural winner in the event.\n\nOn the cycling track, [[Robert Bartko]] beat fellow German [[Jens Lehmann (cyclist)|Jens Lehmann]] in the individual pursuit, setting a new Olympic Record. [[Leontien Zijlaard-van Moorsel]] set a world record in the semi-finals the same event for women.\n\nIn the swimming pool, American [[Tom Dolan]] beat the world record in the 400 m [[Medley swimming|medley]], successfully defending the title he won in [[Atlanta]] four years prior. Dutchwoman [[Inge de Bruijn]] also clocked a new world record, beating her own time in the 100 m butterfly final to win by more than a second.\n\n===Day 4–18 September===\nThe main event for the Australians on the fourth day of the Games was the 200 m freestyle. Dutchman [[Pieter van den Hoogenband]] had broken the world record in the semi-finals, taking it from the new Australian hero [[Ian Thorpe]], who came close to the world record in his semi-final heat. As the final race finished, Van den Hoogenband's time was exactly the same as in the semi-finals, finishing ahead of Thorpe by half a second.\n\nChina won the [[gold medal]] in the men's team all-around gymnastics competition, after being the runner-up in the previous two Olympics. The other medals were taken by [[Ukraine]] and Russia, respectively.\n\nZijlaard-van Moorsel lived up to the expectations set by her world record in cycling in the semis by winning the gold medal.\n\n===Day 7–21 September===\nControversy erupted at the Women's Gymnastics All-Around final, when gymnast after gymnast fell on the vault. Some gymnasts were physically injured, and all were shaken, but nothing was done to try to discover the reason most gymnasts were having severe problems. Finally, in the middle of the third round (out of four), it was determined that the vault horse had been set 5&nbsp;cm too low&nbsp;– enough of a difference to throw off the impeccable timing of many of these world-class athletes. While athletes were allowed to vault again, the remedy did not fully repair injuries and shaken confidence. This situation led directly to the elimination of [[Svetlana Khorkina]] from consideration as the top all-around gymnast. The medals were eventually all won by Romanian gymnasts, with [[Andreea Raducan]] becoming the first athlete from her country to win the title since [[Nadia Comaneci]] in 1976. Teammates [[Simona Amanar]] and [[Maria Olaru]] took silver and bronze, respectively. This result also marked the first sweep of the event since the Soviet Union's in 1960.\n\n===Day 9–23 September===\nBy rowing in the winning coxless four, [[Steve Redgrave]] of Great Britain became a member of a select group who had won gold medals at five consecutive Olympics.\n\nThe swimming 4 x 100-metre medley relay of B.J. Bedford, [[Megan Quann]] (Jendrick), [[Jenny Thompson (athlete)|Jenny Thompson]] and [[Dara Torres]] became the first women's relay under 4-minutes, swimming 3:58 and setting a world record, claiming the gold medal for the United States.\n\n===Day 10–24 September===\n[[Rulon Gardner]], never a [[NCAA]] champion or a world medalist, beat [[Alexander Karelin]] of Russia to win gold in the super heavyweight class, [[Greco-Roman wrestling]]. Karelin had won gold in [[1988 Summer Olympics|Seoul]], [[1992 Summer Olympics|Barcelona]] and [[1996 Summer Olympics|Atlanta]]. Before this fight he had never lost in international competition, had been unbeaten in all competitions in 13 years, and had not surrendered a point in a decade.\n\n===Day 11–25 September===\n[[File:Cathy400 mediafrenzy.jpg|thumb|300px|[[Cathy Freeman]] after the 400 metre final]]\nAustralian [[Cathy Freeman]] won the 400 metre final in front of a jubilant Sydney crowd at the [[Stadium Australia|Olympic Stadium]], ahead of Lorraine Graham of Jamaica and [[Katharine Merry]] of Great Britain. Freeman's win made her the first competitor in Olympic Games history to light the [[Olympic Flame]] and then go on to win a [[Gold Medal]]. The attendance at the stadium was 112,524 - the largest attendance for any sport in Olympic Games history.\n\nIn a men's basketball pool match between the [[United States men's national basketball team|USA]] and [[France national basketball team|France]], the USA's [[Vince Carter]] made one of the most famous [[slam dunk|dunks]] in basketball history. After getting the ball off a steal, the 6'6\"/1.98 m Carter drove to the basket, with 7'2\"/2.18 m centre [[Frédéric Weis]] in his way. Carter jumped, spread his legs in midair, scraped Weis' head on the way up, and dunked. The French media dubbed the feat ''le dunk de la mort'' (\"the dunk of death\").\n\n===Day 14–28 September===\nThe [[Canadian flag]] at athletes' village is lowered to half-staff as Canadian athletes pay tribute to former prime minister [[Pierre Trudeau]] after hearing of his [[Death and state funeral of Pierre Trudeau|death]] in Montreal (Because of the time difference, it was 29 September in Sydney when Trudeau died). The Canadian flag flew at half-staff for the remainder of the Olympics, on orders from both IOC President Juan Antonio Samaranch and Canadian Foreign Affairs Minister [[Lloyd Axworthy]], as the state funeral did not take place until 3 October.\n\n===Day 16–30 September===\n[[Cameroon national football team|Cameroon]] won a historic gold medal over [[Spain national football team|Spain]] in the Men's Olympic [[association football|Football]] Final at the Olympic Stadium. The game went to a penalty shootout, which was won by Cameroon 5–3.<ref>{{cite web | title = Patrick Mboma|url=http://en.beijing2008.cn/spirit/pastgames/halloffame/m/n214045822.shtml  | accessdate =9 July 2010 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130517151346/http://en.beijing2008.cn/spirit/pastgames/halloffame/m/n214045822.shtml |archivedate=17 May 2013}}</ref>\n\n===Day 17–1 October===\n{{See also|2000 Summer Olympics closing ceremony}}\n[[File:Fireworks, Sydney Harbour Bridge, 2000 Summer Olympics closing ceremony.jpg|thumb|right|Olympic colours on the [[Sydney Harbour Bridge]].]]\nThe last event of the games was the Men's Marathon, contested on a course that started in North Sydney. The event was won by [[Ethiopia]]n Genzhnge Abera, with Eric Wananina second and Tesefe Tola, also of Ethiopia third. It was the first time since the 1968 Olympics that an Ethiopian had won the gold medal in this event.\n\nThe Closing Ceremony commenced with [[Christine Anu]] singing her version of the [[Warumpi Band]]'s song, [[My Island Home]]. She performed with several [[Aboriginal Australians|Aboriginal]] dancers atop the Geodome Stage in the middle of the stadium, around which several hundred umbrella and lampbox kids created an image of Aboriginal dreamtime.\n\nThe Geodome Stage was used throughout the ceremony, which is a flat stage which is mechanically raised into the shape of a [[Geode]].\n\nIOC President [[Juan Antonio Samaranch]] declared at the Closing Ceremony,<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2000/10/02/sports/sydney-2000-closing-ceremony-a-fond-farewell-from-australia.html|title=Sydney 2000: Closing Ceremony; A fond farewell from Australia|date=2 October 2000|first=Jere|last=Longman|newspaper=New York Times| accessdate=12 May 2010 }}</ref>\n{{quote|\"I am proud and happy to proclaim that you have presented to the world the best Olympic Games ever.\"}}\nSubsequent Summer Olympics held in [[2004 Summer Olympics|Athens]], [[2008 Summer Olympics|Beijing]] and [[2012 Summer Olympics|London]] have been described by Samaranch's successor, [[Jacques Rogge]], as \"unforgettable, dream Games\", \"truly exceptional\" and \"happy and glorious games\" respectively&nbsp;– the practice of declaring games the \"best ever\" having been retired after the 2000 games.\n\nThe [[Olympic Hymn]] was sung by soprano [[Yvonne Kenny]]. The ceremony also featured performing artists such as [[Jimmy Barnes]], [[INXS]], [[Midnight Oil]], [[Kylie Minogue]], [[Slim Dusty]], [[Christine Anu]], [[Nikki Webster]], [[John Paul Young]], [[Men at Work]], Melbourne-based singer [[Vanessa Amorosi]], [[Tommy Emmanuel]], and pop duo [[Savage Garden]].\n\nThe Games were then handed over to their modern birthplace, [[Athens]], which succeeded Sydney as summer Olympic host city. Two Greek flags were raised; one to honour the birthplace of the Olympics, and the other to honour Athens. The ceremony concluded with a huge [[fireworks]] display on [[Port Jackson|Sydney Harbour]]. The fireworks display itself concluded with a very low flyover of Stadium Australia by an [[General Dynamics F-111C|RAAF F-111C]] which performed a [[Dump and burn|dump-and-burn]] manoeuvre synchronised with the extinction of the [[Olympic Flame]]. This created the appearance of the flame being carried away into the sky, flying in a northeasterly direction out across Sydney Harbour and ultimately towards Athens in a symbolic handover.\n\nIn honour of her gold medal win during the games, [[Cathy Freeman]] represented [[Oceania]] in carrying the Olympic flag, joining Archbishop [[Desmond Tutu]] (Africa), [[John Glenn]] (The Americas), [[Kazuyoshi Funaki]] (Asia), [[Lech Wałęsa]] (Europe), [[Jean-Michel Cousteau]] (Environment), [[Jean-Claude Killy]] (Sport), and [[Steven Spielberg]] (Culture) when it was raised again, at the [[2002

reporting to the CEO are organised primarily along functional lines with only a limited number of divisions (e.g. Interstate Football and Villages) anticipating a venue focussed design.]]\n[[File:SOCOG org structure 1999.gif|thumb|300px|SOCOG organisational structure circa 1999&nbsp;– functional divisions and precinct/venue streams are organised in a matrix structure linked to the Main Operations Centre (MOC). Some functions such as Project Management (in the Games Coordination group) continue to exist largely outside this matrix structure.]]\n\n===Organisations responsible for the Olympics===\nA number of quasi-government bodies were responsible for the construction, organisation and execution of the Sydney Games. These included:\n*the Sydney Organising Committee for the Olympic Games (SOCOG), primarily responsible for the staging of the Games\n*Olympic Coordination Authority (OCA), primarily responsible for construction and oversight\n*Olympic Roads & Transport Authority (ORTA)\n*[[Olympic Security Command Centre]] (OSCC)\n*Olympic Intelligence Centre (OIC)\n*[[Joint Task Force Gold|JTF Gold]] the [[Australian Defence Force]] Joint Taskforce Gold\n*Sydney Olympic Broadcasting Organisation (nominally part of SOCOG)\n*[[IBM]], provider of technology and the Technical Command Centre\n*[[Telstra]], provider of telecommunications\n*[[Great Big Events]], event management and marketing\n\nThese organisations worked closely together and with other bodies such as:\n*the [[International Olympic Committee]] (IOC)\n*the [[Australian Olympic Committee]] (AOC)\n*the other 197 [[National Olympic Committees]] (NOCs)\n*the 33 [[List of International Sport Federations|International Sports Federations]] (IFs)\n*all three levels of Australian government (federal, state and local)\n*dozens of official sponsor and hundreds of official supplier companies\n\nThese bodies are often collectively referred to as the \"Olympic Family\".\n\n===Organisation of the Paralympics===\nOrganisation of the [[2000 Summer Paralympics]] was the responsibility of [[Sydney Paralympic Organising Committee|SPOC]] the Sydney Paralympic Organising Committee. However much of the planning and operation of the Paralympic Games was outsourced to SOCOG such that most operational programmes planned both the Olympic and Paralympic Games.\n\n===Other Olympic events===\nOrganisation of the Games included not only the actual sporting events but also the management (and sometimes construction) of the sporting venues and surrounding precincts, the organisation of the [[Sydney Olympic Arts Festival]] and [[2000 Summer Olympics torch relay|Olympic torch relay]]. The relay began in Greece and travelled to Australia via numerous Oceania island nations.\n\n===Phases of the Olympic project===\nThe staging of the Olympics were treated as a [[project]] on a vast scale, with the project broken into several broad phases:\n*1993 to 1996&nbsp;– positioning\n*1997&nbsp;– going operational\n*1998&nbsp;– procurement/venuisation\n*1999&nbsp;– testing/refinement\n*2000&nbsp;– implementation\n*2001&nbsp;– post implementation and wind-down\n\n===SOCOG organisational design===\nThe internal organisation of SOCOG evolved over the phases of the project and changed, sometimes radically, several times.\n\nIn late 1998 the design was principally ''functional''. The top two tiers below the CEO [[Sandy Hollway]] consisted of five ''groups'' (managed by Group General Managers and the Deputy CEO) and twenty ''divisions'' (managed by divisional General Managers), which in turn were further broken up into ''programmes'' and sub-programmes or ''projects''.\n\nIn 1999 functional areas (FAs) broke up into geographic precinct and venue teams (managed by Precinct Managers and Venue Managers) with functional area staff reporting to both the FA manager and the venue manager. Ie, SOCOG moved to a matrix structure. The Interstate Football division extant in 1998 was the first of these geographically based venue teams.\n\n===Volunteer programme===\nThe origins of the volunteer programme for Sydney 2000 dates back to the bid, as early as 1992.\n\nOn 17 December 1992, a group of Sydney citizens, interested in the prospect of hosting the 2000 Olympic and Paralympic Games, gathered for a meeting at Sports House, at [[Wentworth Park]] in Sydney.\n\nIn the period leading up to 1999, after Sydney had won the bid, the small group of volunteers grew from approximately 42 to around 500. These volunteers became known as Pioneer Volunteers. The Pioneer Volunteer programme was managed internally by SOCOG's Volunteer Services Department in consultation with prominent peak groups like The Centre for Volunteering (Volunteering and [[TAFE]]. Some of the Pioneer Volunteers still meet every four months, an unseen legacy of the games which brought together a community spirit not seen before.\n\nDuring the Olympic games tens of thousands of volunteers, the official figure was placed at 46,967,<ref>{{cite web|title=Sydney 2000 International Olympic Committee |url=http://www.olympic.org/uk/games/past/index_uk.asp?OLGT=1&OLGY=2000 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5iStIioea?url=http://www.olympic.org/uk/games/past/index_uk.asp?OLGT=1&OLGY=2000 |archivedate=22 July 2009 |deadurl=no |accessdate=8 July 2009 |df= }}</ref> helped everywhere at the Olympic venues and elsewhere in the city.

It is an [[classical antiquity|ancient]] sport, as demonstrated by the fifth-century-BC [[Myron]] statue, ''[[Discobolus]]''. Although not part of the [[modern pentathlon]], it was one of the events of the [[Ancient Olympic pentathlon|ancient Greek pentathlon]], which can be dated back to at least to 708 BC.<ref>[http://www.olympic.org/uk/passion/collectors/object/gallery_uk.asp?ObjId=318 Notations on the 1920 discus stamps at the Olympic Museum]</ref>\n\n==History==\n[[Image:Diskuskastare Gbg - Alkamenes.jpg|thumb|Modern copy of the ''Diskophoros'', attributed to [[Alkamenes]]]]\nDiscus is a routine part of most modern track-and-field meets at all levels and is a sport which is particularly iconic of the [[Olympic Games]]. The men's competition has been a part of the modern [[Summer Olympic Games]] since the [[1896 Summer Olympics|first Olympic games in 1896]]. Images of discus throwers figured prominently in advertising for early modern Games, such as fundraising stamps for the 1896 games and [[:Image:1920 olympics poster.jpg|the main posters]] for the [[1920 Summer Olympics|1920]] and [[1948 Summer Olympics]].\n\nThe discus was re-discovered in [[Magdeburg]], Germany, by [[Christian Georg Kohlrausch]] and his students in the 1870s. His work around the discus and the earlier throwing techniques have been published since the 1880.\n\nThe first modern athlete to throw the discus while rotating the whole body was [[František Janda-Suk]] from [[Bohemia]] (present [[Czech Republic]]). {{Citation needed|date=March 2017}} He invented this technique when studying the position of the famous statue of Discobolus. After only one year of developing the technique he gained the olympic silver in 1900.\n\nThe women's competition was added to the Olympic program in the [[1928 Summer Olympics|1928 games]], although they had been competing at some national and regional levels previously.\n\n==Description==\n[[Image:Discobolus Kleomelos Louvre G111.jpg|thumb|left|Discus-thrower, tondo of a [[kylix (drinking cup)|kylix]] by the Kleomelos Painter, [[Louvre Museum]]]]\n[[Image:Discus Thrower Copenhagen.jpg|thumb|left|Modern copy of [[Myron]]'s ''[[Discobolus]]'' in [[University of Copenhagen Botanical Garden]], [[Denmark]]]]\nThe men's discus is a heavy [[Lens (geometry)|lenticular]] [[disk (mathematics)|disc]] with a weight of {{convert|2|kg|lb}} and diameter of {{convert|22|cm|in}}, the women's discus has a weight of {{convert|1|kg|lb}} and diameter of {{convert|18|cm|in}}.\n\nUnder [[IAAF]] (international) rules, Youth boys (16–17 years) throw the {{convert|1.5|kg|lb}} discus, the Junior men (18–19 years) throw the unique {{convert|1.75|kg|lb}} discus, and the girls/women of those ages throw the {{convert|1|kg|lb}} discus.\n\nIn international competition, men throw the 2&nbsp;kg discus through to age 49. The {{convert|1.5|kg|lb}} discus is thrown by ages 50–59, and men age 60 and beyond throw the {{convert|1|kg|lb}} discus. Women throw the {{convert|1|kg|lb}} discus through to age 74. Starting with age 75, women throw the {{convert|0.75|kg|lb}} discus.\n\nThe typical discus has sides made of plastic, wood, fiberglass, carbon fiber or metal with a metal rim and a metal core to attain the weight. The rim must be smooth, with no roughness or finger holds. A discus with more weight in the rim produces greater angular momentum for any given spin rate, and thus more stability, although it is more difficult to throw. However, a higher rim weight, if thrown correctly, can lead to a farther throw. A solid rubber discus is sometimes used (see [[#United States|in the United States]]).\n\nTo make a throw, the competitor starts in a circle of {{T&Fcalc|2.5|m}} diameter, which is recessed in a concrete pad by {{convert|20|mm|in}}. The thrower typically takes an initial stance facing away from the direction of the throw. He then spins anticlockwise (for right-handers) around one and a half times through the circle to build momentum, then releases his throw. The discus must land within a 34.92-degree sector. The rules of competition for discus are virtually identical to those of [[shot put]], except that the circle is larger, a stop board is not used and there are no form rules concerning how the discus is to be thrown.\n\n\nThe basic motion is a forehanded sidearm movement. The discus is spun off the index finger or the middle finger of the throwing hand. In flight the disc spins clockwise when viewed from above for a right-handed thrower, and anticlockwise for a left-handed thrower. As well as achieving maximum momentum in the discus on throwing, the discus' distance is also determined by the trajectory the thrower imparts, as well as the aerodynamic behavior of the discus. Generally, throws into a moderate headwind achieve the maximum distance. Also, a faster-spinning discus imparts greater gyroscopic stability. The technique of discus throwing is quite difficult to master and needs lots of experience to get right, thus most top throwers are 30 years old or more.\n\n==Phases==\nThe discus technique can be broken down into phases. The purpose is to transfer from the back to the front of the throwing circle while turning through one and a half circles. The speed of delivery is high, and speed is built up during the throw (slow to fast). Correct technique involves the buildup of torque so that maximum force can be applied to the discus on delivery.\n\n[[Image:DiscusRutgerSmith6551.jpg|thumb|[[Rutger Smith]] in phases of the discus throw]]\n\nDuring the wind-up, weight is evenly distributed between the feet, which are about shoulder distance and not overly active. The wind-up sets the tone for the entire throw; the rhythm of the throw is very important.\n\nFocusing on rhythm can bring about the consistency to get in the right positions that many throwers lack. Executing a sound discus throw with solid technique requires perfect balance. This is due to the throw being a linear movement combined with a one and a half rotation and an implement at the end of one arm. Thus, a good discus thrower needs to maintain balance within the circle.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://digitaltrackandfield.com/shot-put-discus-technique/|title=Shot Put and Discus Technique and Training|last=Cappos|first=Scott|date=|website=Digital Track and Field|publisher=|access-date=}}</ref>\n\nFor a right handed thrower, the next stage is to move the weight over the left foot. From this position the right foot is raised, and the athlete 'runs' across the circle. There are various techniques for this stage where the leg swings out to a small or great extent, some athletes turn on their left heel (e.g. Ilke Wylluda<ref>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7vr-6mTLm30</ref>) but turning on the ball of the foot is far more common.\n\nThe aim is to land in the 'power position', the right foot should be in the center and the heel should not touch the ground at any point. The left foot should land very quickly after the right. Weight should be mostly over the back foot with as much torque as possible in the body—so the right arm is high and far back. This is very hard to achieve.\n[http://trackandfield.about.com/od/discus/ss/discustechnique_8.htm#step-heading Power position.]\n\nThe critical stage is the delivery of the discus, from this 'power position' the hips drive through hard, and will be facing the direction of the throw on delivery. Athletes employ various techniques to control the end-point and recover from the throw, such as fixing feet (to pretty much stop dead<ref>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7vr-6mTLm30</ref>), or an active reverse spinning onto the left foot (e.g. Virgilijus Alekna<ref>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhZwyyfBCBo</ref>).\n\nSports scientist [[Richard Ganslen]] researched the ''Aerodynamics of the Discus'', reporting the discus will [[Stall (fluid mechanics)|stall]] at an angle of 29°.<ref>http://archive.auvac.org/research/publications/files/2003/niewiadomska.pdf</ref>\n\n==Culture==\n[[Image:2003 Greece 10 Euro OS Discus front.jpg|thumb|right|[[Euro gold and silver commemorative coins (Greece)#2003 coinage|Discus commemorative coin]]]]\n\nThe discus throw has been the subject of a number of well-known ancient Greek statues and Roman copies such as the [[Discobolus]] and [[Discophoros]]. The discus throw also appears repeatedly in ancient [[Greek mythology]], featured as a means of [[manslaughter]] in the cases of [[Hyacinth (mythology)|Hyacinth]], [[Crocus (mythology)|Crocus]], [[Phocus#Phocus.2C son of Aeacus|Phocus]], and [[Acrisius]], and as a named event in the [[funeral games]] of [[Patroclus]].\n\nDiscus throwers have been selected as a main motif in numerous collectors' coins. One of the recent samples is the €10 Greek [[Euro gold and silver commemorative coins (Greece)#2003 coinage|Discus commemorative coin]], minted in 2003 to commemorate the [[2004 Summer Olympics]]. On the obverse of the coin a modern athlete is seen in the foreground in a half-turned position, while in the background an ancient discus thrower has been captured in a lively bending motion, with the discus high above his head, creating a vivid representation of the sport.\n\n==United States==\nIn U.S. high school track and field, boys typically throw a discus weighing 1.6&nbsp;kg (3&nbsp;lb&nbsp;9&nbsp;oz) and the girls throw the 1&nbsp;kg (2.2&nbsp;lb) women's discus. Under USATF Youth rules, boys throw the 1&nbsp;kg discus between the ages of 11–14, and transition to the 1.6&nbsp;kg discus as 15- to 18-year-olds. Girls throw the 1&nbsp;kg discus as 11- to 18-year-olds.\n\nUnder [[National Federation of State High School Associations|US high school rules]], if a discus hits the surrounding safety cage and is deflected into the sector, it is ruled a foul.  In contrast, under [[IAAF]], [[World Masters Athletics|WMA]], [[NCAA]] and [[USATF]] rules, it is ruled a legal throw.  Additionally, under US high school rules, distances thrown are rounded down to the nearest whole inch, rather than the nearest centimetre.\n\nUS high school rules allow the use of a solid rubber discus; it is cheaper and easier to learn to throw (due to its more equal distribution of weight, as opposed to the heavy rim weight of the metal rim/core discus), but less durable.\n\n==Top 25 performers==\n{{see also|Men's discus throw world record progression|Women's discus throw world record progression}}\n[[Image:BASA-3K-7-422-22-1896 Summer Olympics.jpg|thumb|[[Robert Garrett]] at the [[1896 Summer Olympics]]]]\n[[Image:Osaka07 D4A Gerd Kanter Lastatt.jpg|thumb|[[Gerd Kanter]] in Osaka]]\n\n*Correct as of July 2017.<ref name=\"Top All-time Throws\">[http://www.iaaf.org/records/toplists/throws/discus-throw/outdoor/men/senior Discus Throw - men - senior - outdoor].

Following [[Adolf Hitler's rise to power|Hitler's rise to power]] in 1933, the government passed laws to exclude Jews from civil society, most prominently the [[Nuremberg Laws]] in 1935. Starting in 1933, the Nazis built a network of [[Nazi concentration camps|concentration camps]] in Germany for political opponents and people deemed \"undesirable\". After the [[invasion of Poland]] in 1939, the regime set up [[Nazi ghettos|ghettos]] to segregate Jews. Over 42,000 camps, ghettos, and other detention sites were established.<ref name=42000facilities>[https://www.ushmm.org/research/publications/encyclopedia-camps-ghettos \"Encyclopedia of Camps and Ghettos, 1933–1945\"], United States Holocaust Memorial Museum.</ref>\n\nThe deportation of Jews to the [[ghetto]]s culminated in the policy of extermination the Nazis called the \"[[Final Solution|Final Solution to the Jewish Question]]\", discussed by senior Nazi officials at the [[Wannsee Conference]] in Berlin in January 1942. As German forces [[Operation Barbarossa|captured territories in the East]], all anti-Jewish measures were radicalized. Under the coordination of the [[Schutzstaffel|SS]], with directions from the highest leadership of the [[Nazi Party]], killings were committed within Germany itself, throughout [[German-occupied Europe]], and across all territories controlled by the [[Axis powers]]. Paramilitary units called ''[[Einsatzgruppen]]'' murdered around two million Jews in mass shootings in less than a year. By mid-1942, victims were being deported from the ghettos in sealed [[Holocaust trains|freight trains]] to [[extermination camp]]s where, if they survived the journey, they were killed in [[Gas chamber#Nazi Germany|gas chambers]].

Many Germans did not accept that their country had been defeated, which gave birth to the [[stab-in-the-back myth]]. This insinuated that it was disloyal politicians, chiefly Jews and communists, who had orchestrated Germany's surrender. Inflaming the anti-Jewish sentiment was the apparent over-representation of Jews in the leadership of communist revolutionary governments in Europe, such as [[Ernst Toller]], head of a short-lived revolutionary government in Bavaria.

The latter two groups were to be sent to concentration camps for \"re-education\", with the aim of eventual absorption into the ''Volksgemeinschaft''. \"Racial\" enemies could never belong to the ''Volksgemeinschaft''; they were to be removed from society.{{sfn|Noakes|Pridham|1983|p=499}}\n\nBefore and after the [[German federal election, March 1933|March 1933 ''Reichstag'' elections]], the Nazis intensified their campaign of violence against opponents.{{sfn|Wachsmann|2015|pp=28–30}} They set up concentration camps for extrajudicial imprisonment.{{sfn|Wachsmann|2015|pp=32–38}} One of the first, at [[Dachau concentration camp|Dachau]], opened on 9 March 1933.{{sfn|Gilbert|1985|p=32}} Initially the camp contained mostly Communists and Social Democrats.{{sfn|Longerich|2012|p=155}} Other early prisons were consolidated by mid-1934 into purpose-built camps outside the cities, run exclusively by the SS.{{sfn|Wachsmann|2015|pp=84–86}} The initial purpose of the camps was to serve as a deterrent by terrorizing Germans who did not conform.{{sfn|Peukert|1987|p=214}}\n\nThroughout the 1930s, the legal, economic, and social rights of Jews were steadily restricted.{{sfn|Friedländer|1997|p=33}} On 1 April 1933, there was a [[Nazi boycott of Jewish businesses|boycott of Jewish businesses]].{{sfn|Evans|2004|pp=434–435}} On 7 April 1933, the [[Law for the Restoration of the Professional Civil Service]] was passed, which excluded Jews and other \"non-Aryans\" from the civil service.{{sfn|Burleigh|Wippermann|1991|p=78}} Jews were [[disbarment|disbarred]] from practising law, being editors or proprietors of newspapers, or joining the Journalists' Association.

Silent color film shot by [[Eva Braun]], May 1939]]\nIn his 1965 essay \"Command and Compliance\", which originated in his work as an expert witness for the prosecution at the [[Frankfurt Auschwitz Trials]], the German historian Hans Buchheim wrote there was no coercion to murder Jews and others, and all who committed such actions did so out of free will.<ref name=Buchheim1968_3723>{{Harvnb|Buchheim|1968|pp=372–3}}.</ref> Buchheim wrote that chances to avoid executing criminal orders \"were both more numerous and more real than those concerned are generally prepared to admit\",{{r|Buchheim1968_3723}} and that he found no evidence that SS men who refused to carry out criminal orders were sent to concentration camps or executed.{{sfn|Buchheim|1968|p=381}} Moreover, SS rules prohibited acts of gratuitous sadism, as Himmler wished for his men to remain \"decent\"; acts of sadism were carried out on the initiative of those who were either especially cruel or wished to prove themselves ardent National Socialists.{{r|Buchheim1968_3723}} Finally, he argued that those of a non-criminal bent who committed crimes did so because they wished to conform to the values of the group they had joined and were afraid of being branded \"weak\" by their colleagues if they refused.{{sfn|Buchheim|1968|pp=386–7}}\n\nSimilarly, in ''Ordinary Men'' (1992), [[Christopher Browning]] examined the deeds of German [[Reserve Police Battalion 101]] of the ''[[Orpo battalions|Ordnungspolizei]]'' (\"order police\"), used to commit massacres and round-ups of Jews, as well as mass deportations to the death camps. The members of the battalion were middle-aged men of working-class background from Hamburg, who were too old for regular military duty. They were given no special training. During the murder of 1,500 Jews from [[Józefów, Biłgoraj County|Józefów]], their commander allowed them to opt out of direct participation. Fewer than 12 men out of a battalion of 500 did so. Influenced by the [[Milgram experiment]] on obedience, Browning argued that the men killed out of peer pressure, not blood lust.{{sfn|Browning|1992|p=57}}\n\n===German public===\nIn his 1983 book, ''Popular Opinion and Political Dissent in the Third Reich'', [[Ian Kershaw]] examined the ''[[Alltagsgeschichte]]'' (history of everyday life) in Bavaria during the Nazi period. The most common viewpoint of Bavarians was indifference towards what was happening to the Jews, he wrote. Most Bavarians were vaguely aware of the genocide, but they were vastly more concerned about the war. Kershaw argued that \"the road to Auschwitz was built by hate, but paved with indifference\".{{sfn|Marrus|2000|pp=89–91}}{{sfn|Evans|1989|p=71}}<!--why not cite Kershaw?-->\n\nKershaw's assessment faced criticism from historians Otto Dov Kulka and Michael Kater. Kater maintained that Kershaw had downplayed the extent of popular antisemitism. Although most of the \"spontaneous\" antisemitic actions of Nazi Germany had been staged, Kater argued that these had involved substantial numbers of Germans, and therefore it was wrong to view the extreme antisemitism of the Nazis as coming solely from above.{{sfn|Marrus|2000|p=92}} Kulka argued that \"passive complicity\" would be a better term than \"indifference\".{{sfn|Marrus|2000|p=93}}<!--why not cite Kulka and Kater?-->\n\nFocusing on the views of Germans opposed to the Nazi regime, the German historian Christof Dipper, in his essay \"''Der Deutsche Widerstand und die Juden''\" (1983), argued that the majority of the anti-Nazi national conservatives were antisemitic. No one in the [[German resistance]] supported the Holocaust, but Dipper wrote that the national conservatives did not intend to restore civil rights to the Jews after the planned overthrow of Hitler.{{sfn|Marrus|2000|p=92}}<!--why not cite Dipper?-->\n\n==Aftermath==\n{{main| Aftermath of the Holocaust}}\n\n===Trials===\n{{main|Nuremberg trials|Dachau trials}}\n[[File:Defendants in the dock at the Nuremberg Trials.jpg|thumb|right|Defendants in the dock at the Nuremberg trials.

It was bound to an even larger plan of racial reordering and reconstruction involving further genocidal killing on an almost unimaginable scale, aimed, however, at clearing the way in a particular region – Eastern Europe – for a further struggle against the Jews and those the Nazis regarded as their puppets. It was set in motion by ideologues who saw world history in racial terms. It was, in part, carried out by industrial methods.

Although particular attention is paid to the four years of [[Chinese Communist Revolution]] from 1945 to 1949, the war actually started in August 1927, with the [[White Terror (mainland China)|White Terror]] at the end of Generalissimo [[Chiang Kai-shek]]'s [[Northern Expedition]], and essentially ended when major hostilities between the two sides ceased in 1950.<ref>{{cite book | editor1-last = Lew | editor1-first = Christopher R. | editor2-first =  Pak-Wah | editor2-last = Leung  | year = 2013 | title = Historical Dictionary of the Chinese Civil War | publisher = Maryland : The Scarecrow Press, Inc. | location = Lanham |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=8WYSAAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover#v= | isbn = 9780810878730 | ref = harv}}, p. 3</ref> The conflict took place in two stages: the first between 1927 and 1937, and the second from 1946 to 1950, with the [[Second Sino-Japanese War]] in 1937–1945 separating them. The war marked a major turning point in modern Chinese history, with the Communists gaining control of mainland China and establishing the [[People's Republic of China]] (PRC) in 1949 and forced the [[Republic of China]] (ROC) to retreat to Taiwan. It resulted in a lasting political and military standoff between the two sides of the [[Taiwan Strait]], with the ROC in [[Geography of Taiwan|Taiwan]] and the PRC on [[mainland China]] with both officially claiming to be the legitimate government of all China.\n\nThe war represented an [[Ideology|ideological]] split between the [[Communism|communist]] CPC and the [[nationalism|nationalist]] KMT. Conflict continued intermittently until late 1937, when the two parties came together to form the [[Second United Front]] to counter the [[Imperial Japanese Army]] threat and to prevent the country from crumbling. Full-scale civil war in China resumed in 1946, a year after the end of hostilities with the [[Empire of Japan]] in September 1945. Four years later came the cessation of major military activity, with the newly founded People's Republic of China controlling mainland China (including the island of [[Hainan]]), and the Republic of China's jurisdiction restricted to Taiwan, [[Penghu]], [[Kinmen|Quemoy]], [[Matsu Islands|Matsu]] and [[list of islands of the Republic of China|several outlying islands]].\n\n{{As of | 2017}} no armistice or peace treaty has ever been signed, and the debate continues as to whether the civil war has legally ended.<ref>{{Cite book | title = The Contemporary Law of Armed Conflict | author = Leslie C. Green | page = 79}}</ref> Relations between both sides, officially called the [[Cross-Strait relations]], have been hindered by [[military threat]]s and political and economic pressure, particularly over [[political status of Taiwan|Taiwan's political status]], with both governments officially adhering to the [[One-China policy]]. The PRC still actively claims Taiwan as part of its territory and continues to threaten the ROC with a military invasion if the ROC officially declares [[Taiwan Independence|independence]] by changing its name to and gaining [[diplomatic recognition|international recognition]] as the \"Republic of Taiwan\". The ROC, for its part, claims mainland China, and both parties continue the fight over diplomatic recognition. {{As of | 2017}} the war as such occurs on the political and economic fronts in the relations without actual military action. However, the two separate governments in China have close economic ties.<ref name=\"so\">\nSo, Alvin Y. Lin, Nan. Poston, Dudley L. Contributor Professor, So, Alvin Y. [2001] (2001).

After the death of Yuan Shikai in 1916, the following years were characterized by the [[Warlord Era|power struggle]]  between different cliques in the former [[Beiyang Army]]. In the meantime, the [[Kuomintang]], led by [[Sun Yat-sen]], created a new government in [[Guangzhou]] to resist the rule of Beiyang Government through [[Constitutional Protection Movement|a series of movements]].\n\nSun's efforts to obtain aid from the Western countries were ignored, thus he turned to the [[Soviet Union]] in 1921. For political expediency, the Soviet leadership initiated a dual policy of support for both Sun and the newly established [[Communist Party of China]], which would eventually found the [[China|People's Republic of China]]. Thus the struggle for power in China began between the KMT and the CPC.\n\nIn 1923, a joint statement by Sun and Soviet representative [[Adolph Joffe]] in [[Shanghai]] pledged Soviet assistance to China's unification.<ref name=\"March\">March, G.

In 1930 the [[Central Plains War]] broke out as an internal conflict of the KMT. It was launched by [[Feng Yuxiang]], [[Yan Xishan]] and [[Wang Jingwei]].

During these campaigns, KMT columns struck swiftly into Communist areas, but were easily engulfed by the vast countryside and were not able to consolidate their foothold.\n\nFinally, in late 1934, Chiang launched a [[fifth Encirclement Campaign against Hubei-Henan-Anhui Soviet|fifth campaign]] that involved the systematic encirclement of the [[Jiangxi–Fujian Soviet|Jiangxi Soviet]] region with fortified [[blockhouse]]s.<ref name=\"Manwaring\">Manwaring, Max G.

The warlord armies were reluctant to challenge Communist forces for fear of losing their own men and did not pursue the CPC with much fervor. In addition, the main KMT forces were preoccupied with annihilating [[Zhang Guotao]]'s army, which was much larger than Mao's. The massive military retreat of Communist forces lasted a year and covered what Mao estimated as 12,500&nbsp;km (25,000 [[Li (unit)|Li]]); it became known as the [[Long March]].<ref name=\"Zhang\">Zhang, Chunhou.

It consisted of a series of marches, during which numerous Communist armies in the south escaped to the north and west. Over the course of the march from Jiangxi the First Front Army, led by an inexperienced military commission, was on the brink of annihilation by Chiang Kai Shek's troops as their stronghold was in Jiangxi. The Communists, under the command of Mao Zedong and Zhou Enlai, \"escaped in a circling retreat to the west and north, which reportedly traversed over 9,000 kilometers over 370 days\". The route passed through some of the most difficult terrain of western China by traveling west, and then northwards towards Shaanxi. \"In November 1935, shortly after settling in northern Shaanxi, Mao officially took over Zhou Enlai's leading position in the Red Army. Following a major reshuffling of official roles, Mao became the chairman of the Military Commission, with Zhou and Deng Xiaoping as vice-chairmen.\" This marked Mao's position as the pre-eminent leader of the Party, with Zhou in second position to him.{{citation needed|date=November 2016}}\n\nThe march ended when the CPC reached the interior of [[Shaanxi]]. [[Zhang Guotao]]'s army, which took a different route through northwest China, was largely destroyed by the forces of Chiang Kai-shek and his [[Hui people|Chinese Muslim]] allies, the [[Ma clique]]. Along the way, the Communist army confiscated property and weapons from local warlords and landlords, while recruiting peasants and the poor, solidifying its appeal to the masses. Of the 90,000–100,000 people who began the Long March from the Soviet Chinese Republic, only around 7,000–8,000 made it to Shaanxi.<ref name=\"Bianco\">[[Lucien Bianco|Bianco, Lucien]]. Bell, Muriel.

Essentially, the great retreat made Mao the undisputed leader of the Communist Party of China.\n\nThe Kuomintang used [[Kham]]pa troops—who were former bandits—to battle the Communist Red Army as it advanced and to undermine local warlords who often refused to fight Communist forces to conserve their own strength. The KMT enlisted 300 \"Khampa bandits\" into its Consolatory Commission military in Sichuan, where they were part of the effort of the central government to penetrate and destabilize local Han warlords such as [[Liu Wenhui]]. The government was seeking to exert full control over frontier areas against the warlords. Liu had refused to battle the Communists in order to conserve his army. The Consolatory Commission forces were used to battle the Red Army, but they were defeated when their religious leader was captured by the Communists.<ref>{{cite book|accessdate=2011-12-27|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=rsLQdBUgyMUC&pg=PA52&dq=force+of+about+300+soldiers+was+organized+and+augmented+by+recruiting+local+Khampa+bandits+into+the+army&hl=en&sa=X&ei=5vcDT6LcBeTV0QG_6rUB&ved=0CDAQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&q=force%20of%20about%20300%20soldiers%20was%20organized%20and%20augmented%20by%20recruiting%20local%20Khampa%20bandits%20into%20the%20army&f=false|title=Modern China's Ethnic Frontiers: A Kourney to the West|author=Hsiao-ting Lin|editor=|year=2010|publisher=Taylor & Francis|edition=illustrated|location=|volume=Volume 67 of Routledge studies in the modern history of Asia |page=52 |quote=A force of about 300 soldiers was organized and augmented by recruiting local Khampa bandits into the army.

Chiang preferred to unite China by eliminating the warlords and CPC forces first. He believed that he was still too weak to launch an offensive to chase out Japan and that China needed time for a military build-up. Only after unification would it be possible for the KMT to mobilize a war against Japan. So he would rather ignore the discontent and anger among Chinese people at his policy of compromise with the Japanese, and ordered KMT generals [[Zhang Xueliang]] and [[Yang Hucheng]] to carry out suppression of the CPC; however, their provincial forces suffered significant casualties in battles with the Red Army.[https://web.archive.org/web/20121207115613/http://history.cultural-china.com/en/34H7514H12570.html ref]\n\nOn 12 December 1936, the disgruntled Zhang Xueliang and Yang Hucheng conspired to kidnap Chiang and force him into a truce with the CPC.

In December 1940 Chiang demanded that the CPC's [[New Fourth Army]] evacuate [[Anhui]] and [[Jiangsu]] Provinces due to its provocation and harassment of KMT forces in this area. Under intense pressure, the New Fourth Army commanders complied. In 1941 they were [[New Fourth Army incident|ambushed]] by KMT forces during their evacuation, which led to several thousand deaths.<ref name=\"schok\">Schoppa, R. Keith. [2000] (2000).

After the [[New Fourth Army incident]], US President [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] sent special envoy [[Lauchlin Currie]] to talk with Chiang Kai-shek and KMT party leaders to express their concern regarding the hostility between the two parties, with Currie stating that the only ones to benefit from a civil war would be the Japanese. In 1941 the Soviet Union, with its closer alliance to the CPC, also sent an imperative telegram to Mao warning that the civil war would also make the situation easier for the Japanese military. Due to the international community's efforts, there was a temporary and superficial peace. In 1943 Chiang attacked the CPC with the propaganda piece ''China's Destiny'', which questioned the CPC's power after the war, while the CPC strongly opposed Chiang's leadership and referred to his regime as fascist in an attempt to generate a negative public image. Both leaders knew that a deadly battle had begun between themselves.<ref name=\"Chen\">Chen, Jian. [2001] (2001). Mao's China and the Cold War.

It avoided the strong points of the KMT army and was prepared to abandon territory in order to preserve its forces. In most cases the surrounding countryside and small towns had come under Communist influence long before the cities. The CPC also attempted to wear out the KMT forces as much as possible.

According to Mao Zedong, there were three ways of \"staving off imperialist intervention in the short term\" during the continuation of the Chinese Revolution. The first was through a rapid completion of the military takeover of the country, and through showing determination and strength against \"foreign attempts at challenging the new regime along its borders\". The second was by \"formalising a comprehensive military alliance with the Soviet Union\", which would dedicate Soviet power to directly defending China against its enemies; this aspect became extensively significant given the backdrop of the start of the Cold War. And finally the regime had to \"root out its domestic opponents : the heads of secret societies, religious sects, independent unions, or tribal and ethic organisations.\" By destroying the basis of domestic reaction, Mao believed a safer world for the Chinese revolution to spread in would come into existence.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&lr=&id=jbcoecrg5nec&oi=fnd&pg=pr11&dq=chinese%2bcivil%2bwar&ots=keixlpcfax&sig=dcoktn9bpl7lnyjx4ibf_y-0uxg#v=onepage&q=chinese%20civil%20war&f=false.

Meanwhile, the Communists targeted different groups, such as peasants, and brought them to its corner.<ref>Odd Arne Westad, ''Restless Empire: China and the World Since 1750'' (2012) p 291.</ref>\n\nChiang wrote in his diary in June 1948 that the KMT had failed not because of external enemies but because of rot from within.<ref>[http://www.hoover.org/publications/digest/6731746.html Hoover Institution&nbsp;– Hoover Digest&nbsp;– Chiang Kai-shek and the Struggle for China] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070730081935/http://www.hoover.org/publications/digest/6731746.html |date=2007-07-30 }}</ref>\n\nThe USSR generally supported Chiang's forces. Stalin distrusted Mao, tried to block him from leadership as late as 1942, and worried that Mao would become an independent rival force in world communism.<ref>{{cite book|author=Helen Rappaport|title=Joseph Stalin: A Biographical Companion|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=lsKClpnX8qwC&pg=PA36|year=1999|publisher=ABC-CLIO|page=36}}</ref>\n\nStrong American support for the Nationalists was hedged with the failure of the [[Marshall Mission]], and then stopped completely mainly because of KMT corruption <ref>http://www.ea.sinica.edu.tw/eu_file/12010586724.pdf</ref> (such as the notorious Yangtze Development Corporation <ref>[http://media.hoover.org/sites/default/files/documents/soong_register.pdf T.

Soong]]'s family) <ref>http://big5.backchina.com/blog/323944/article-142137.html</ref> and KMT's military setback in Northeast China.\n\nCommunist land reform policy promised poor peasants farmland from their landlords, ensuring popular support for the [[People's Liberation Army|PLA]].\n\nThe main advantage of the Chinese Communist Party was the \"extraordinary cohesion\" within the top level of its leadership. These skills were not only secured from defections that came about during difficult times but also coupled with \"communications and top level debates over tactics\". A big addition to this was the charismatic style of leadership of Mao Zedong which created a \"unity of purpose\" and a \"unity of command\" which the KMT lacked majorly. Apart from that the CPC had mastered the manipulation of local politics to their benefit, this was also derived from their propaganda skills that had also been decentralised successfully. By \"portraying their opponents as enemies of all groups of Chinese\" and itself as \"defenders of the nation\" and people (given the backdrop of the war with Japan).<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&lr=&id=jbcoecrg5nec&oi=fnd&pg=pr11&dq=chinese%2bcivil%2bwar&ots=keixlpcfax&sig=dcoktn9bpl7lnyjx4ibf_y-0uxg#v=onepage&q=chinese%20civil%20war&f=false. ''Decisive Encounters''] By Westad, Odd Arne. Stanford University Press, 2003 (Google Books).</ref>\n\nIn the Chinese Civil War after 1945, the economy in the ROC areas collapsed because of [[hyperinflation]] and the failure of price controls by the ROC government and financial reforms; the Gold Yuan devaluated sharply in late 1948 <ref>http://www.mof.gov.tw/museum/ct.asp?xItem=3682&ctNode=34</ref> and resulted in the ROC government losing the support of the cities' middle classes. In the meantime, the Communists continued their relentless land reform (land redistribution) programs to win the support of the population in the countryside.\n\n== Atrocities ==\nDuring the war both the Nationalists and Communists carried out mass atrocities, with millions of non-combatants deliberately killed by both sides.<ref>Rummel, Rudolph (1994), Death by Government.</ref> Benjamin Valentino has estimated atrocities in the Chinese Civil War resulted in the death of between 1.8 million and 3.5 million people between 1927 and 1949.

Despite its name, the conference consists of 14 members (as of 2017). They compete in the [[NCAA Division I]]; its [[College football|football]] teams compete in the [[NCAA Division I Football Bowl Subdivision|Football Bowl Subdivision]] (FBS), formerly known as Division I-A, the highest level of NCAA competition in that sport. The conference includes the flagship public university in each of 11 states stretching from New Jersey to Nebraska, as well as two additional public land grant schools and a private university.\n\nThe Big Ten Conference was established in 1895 when [[Purdue University]] president James H. Smart and representatives from the [[University of Chicago]], [[University of Illinois]], [[University of Michigan]], [[University of Minnesota]], [[Northwestern University]], and [[University of Wisconsin]] gathered at Chicago's [[The Palmer House Hilton|Palmer House Hotel]] to set policies aimed at regulating intercollegiate athletics. In 1905, the conference was officially incorporated as the \"Intercollegiate Conference of Faculty Representatives\".<ref>http://www.bigten.org/school-bio/big10-school-bio.html</ref>\n\nBig Ten member institutions are predominantly major [[Flagship university|flagship]] [[research universities]] with large financial endowments and strong academic reputations. Large student enrollment is also a hallmark of Big Ten universities, as 12 of the 14 members feature enrollments of 30,000 or more students. [[Northwestern University]], one of just two full members with a total enrollment of fewer than 30,000 students (the other is the [[University of Nebraska–Lincoln]]), is the lone [[private university]] among Big Ten membership (the University of Chicago, a private university, left the conference in 1946). Collectively, Big Ten universities educate more than 520,000 total students and have 5.7 million living alumni.<ref name=\"bigten.org\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.bigten.org/genrel/070114aaa.html|title=University of Maryland and Rutgers University Become Official Members of Big Ten Conference|website=www.bigten.org|access-date=2016-06-21}}</ref> Big Ten universities engage in $9.3 billion in funded research each year.<ref>http://www.cic.net/about-cic/cic-expansion/press-releases</ref> Though the Big Ten existed for nearly a century as an assemblage of universities located primarily in the [[Midwestern United States|Midwest]], the conference's geographic footprint now stretches east to the Atlantic Ocean.\n\nBig Ten universities are also members of the [[Big Ten Academic Alliance]], an academic [[consortium]].

[https://web.archive.org/web/20071220054555/http://www.mndaily.com/daily/1999/02/08/sports/irish/] Notre Dame subsequently joined the Atlantic Coast Conference in all sports except football, in which Notre Dame maintains its independent status as long as it plays at least five games per season against ACC opponents.

Those division names, as well as the conference's new logo, were made public on December 13, 2010.  For their new logo, the conference replaced the \"hidden 11\" logo with one that uses the \"B1G\" character combination in its branding.  Delany did not comment on the logo that day, but it was immediately evident that the new logo would \"allow fans to see 'BIG' and '10' in a single word.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bigten.org/newlogo/|title=Big Ten Conference Reveals New Logo and Honors Football History with Division Names and Trophies|publisher=Big Ten Conference |accessdate=2 April 2014|quote=\"The new Big Ten logo was developed to symbolize the conference's future, as well as its rich heritage, strong tradition of competition, academic leadership, and passionate alumni,\" said Gericke. \"Its contemporary collegiate lettering includes an embedded numeral \"10\" in the word \"BIG\", which allows fans to see \"BIG\" and \"10\" in a single word.

The new logo also provides the flexibility of multiple versions which can be used horizontally, vertically and within new media.\"}}</ref>\n\nFor the new football division names, the Big Ten was unable to use geographic names, as used by the SEC, because they had rejected a geographic arrangement.  Delany announced that the new divisions would be known as the \"Legends Division\" and \"Leaders Division\". In the Legends division were Iowa, Michigan, Michigan State, Minnesota, Nebraska and Northwestern. The Leaders division was composed of Illinois, Indiana, Ohio State, Penn State, Purdue and Wisconsin.

Michigan appeared in the first [[bowl game]], the [[1902 Rose Bowl]]. After that, the Big Ten did not allow their schools to participate in bowl games, until the agreement struck with the Pacific Coast Conference for the [[1947 Rose Bowl]]. From 1946 through 1971, the Big Ten did not allow the same team to represent the conference in consecutive years in the Rose Bowl with an exception made after the 1961 season in which Minnesota played in the [[1962 Rose Bowl]] after playing in the [[1961 Rose Bowl]] due to Ohio State declining the bid because of Ohio State faculty concerns about academics.\n\nIt was not until the 1975 season that the Big Ten allowed teams to play in bowl games other than the Rose Bowl. Michigan, which had been shut out of the postseason the previous three years, was the first beneficiary of the new rule when it played in the Orange Bowl vs. Oklahoma. Due to the pre-1975 rules, Big Ten teams such as Michigan and Ohio State have lower numbers of all-time bowl appearances than powerhouse teams from the [[Big 12 Conference]] (previously Big Eight and Southwest Conferences) and [[Southeastern Conference]], which always placed multiple teams in bowl games every year.\n\nStarting in the 2014–15 season, a new slate of bowl game selections will include several new bowl games.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://espn.go.com/blog/bigten/post/_/id/79872/b1g-to-share-spot-in-gator-music-city-bowls|title=B1G to share Gator, Music City bowl tie-ins – July 18, 2013, |accessdate=2013-12-08}}</ref>\n\n{|class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"text-align: center;\"\n|-\n! style=\"width:55px;\" | Pick\n! style=\"width:260px;\"| Name\n! style=\"width:190px;\"| Location\n! style=\"width:105px;\"| Opposing <br> Conference\n! style=\"width:40px;\" | Opposing Pick \n|-\n| 1\n| [[Rose Bowl Game|Rose Bowl]]*\n| [[Pasadena, California]]\n| [[Pac-12 Conference|Pac-12]]\n| 1\n|-\n| 2/3/4 or 2\n| [[Citrus Bowl (game)|Citrus Bowl]] or [[Orange Bowl]]^\n| [[Orlando, Florida]] or [[Miami Gardens, Florida]]\n| [[Southeastern Conference|SEC]] or [[Atlantic Coast Conference|ACC]]\n| 2 or 1\n|-\n| 2/3/4\n| [[Outback Bowl]]\n| [[Tampa, Florida]]\n| SEC\n| 4/5/6/7\n|-\n| 2/3/4 \n| [[Holiday Bowl]]<ref name=\"Big Ten Conference\">{{cite press release|url=http://www.bigten.org/sports/m-footbl/spec-rel/072313aaa.html |title=Big Ten Extends Relationship with the Heart of Dallas Bowl and Adds the Bell Helicopter Armed Forces Bowl to the Rotation |publisher=Big Ten Conference |date=July 23, 2013 |accessdate=December 8, 2013}}</ref>\n| [[San Diego]]\n| Pac-12\n| 3\n|-\n| 5/6/7\n| [[Music City Bowl]] or [[TaxSlayer Bowl]]†<ref>{{cite web|url=http://nashvillecitypaper.com/content/sports/agreement-expands-music-city-bowls-potential-participants-pool|title=Agreement expands Music City Bowl's potential participants' pool – July 18, 2013, |accessdate=2013-12-08}}</ref>\n| [[Nashville, Tennessee]] or [[Jacksonville, Florida]]\n| SEC\n| 4/5/6/7\n|-\n| 5/6/7\n| [[Foster Farms Bowl]]<ref>{{cite press release|url=http://www.bigten.org/sports/m-footbl/spec-rel/062413aab.html |title=Kraft Fight Hunger Bowl to Feature Big Ten vs. Pac-12 Matchup Beginning in 2014 |publisher=Big Ten Conference |date=June 24, 2013 |accessdate=December 8, 2013}}</ref>\n| [[Santa Clara, California]] \n| Pac-12\n| 4\n|-\n| 5/6/7\n| [[Pinstripe Bowl]]<ref>{{cite press release|url=http://www.bigten.org/sports/m-footbl/spec-rel/060313aac.html |title=Big Ten Announces Partnership With New York Yankees and New Era Pinstripe Bowl |publisher=Big Ten Conference |date=June 3, 2013 |accessdate=December 8, 2013}}</ref>\n| New York City \n| ACC\n| 3/4/5/6\n|-\n| 8/9\n| [[Quick Lane Bowl]]<ref>{{cite press release|url=http://www.detroitlions.com/news/article-1/The-Detroit-Lions-announce-agreement-with-the-Big-Ten-for-Bowl-Game-at-Ford-Field/ed3156cf-d3cb-4de6-aec5-acedd35e02fb |title=The Detroit Lions announce agreement with the Big Ten for Bowl Game at Ford Field |publisher=Detroit Lions |date=July 17, 2013 |accessdate=December 8, 2013}}</ref>\n| [[Detroit]] \n| ACC\n| 7/8/9\n|-\n| 8/9\n| [[Heart of Dallas Bowl]] or {{nowrap|[[Armed Forces Bowl]]‡<ref name=\"Big Ten Conference\"/>}}\n| [[Dallas]] or [[Fort Worth, Texas]]\n| [[Conference USA|C–USA]]\n| –\n|}\n\n<nowiki>*</nowiki> If the conference champion is picked for the [[College Football Playoff]] in years the Rose Bowl does not host a semifinal, the next highest ranked team in the committee rankings, or runner up, shall take its place at the Rose Bowl.\n\n^ The Big Ten, along with the SEC, will be eligible to face the ACC representative in the Orange Bowl at least three out of the eight seasons that it does not host a semifinal for the Playoff over a 12-year span.

Picks are made after CFP selections; the bowl with the #2 pick will have the first pick of the remaining teams in the conference.\n\nFor all non-College Football Playoff partners, the bowl partner will request a Big Ten team. The Big Ten will approve or assign another team based on internal selection parameters.\n\nWhen not hosting a semifinal, the Capital One Orange Bowl will select the highest-ranked team from the Big Ten, SEC or Notre Dame to face an ACC opponent. The Big Ten Champion cannot play in the Orange Bowl. If a Big Ten team is not selected by the Orange Bowl, the Citrus Bowl will submit a request for a Big Ten team.\n\nThe Outback, Foster Farms and Holiday Bowls will feature at least five different Big Ten schools over the six-year agreement (through 2019 season). The Music City and Taxslayer Bowl will coordinate their selections allowing only one to pick a Big Ten team. The Big Ten will make appearances in three of each bowl games over the term of the agreement (through 2019 season).\n\nThe New Era Pinstripe Bowl will feature a minimum of six different Big Ten teams over the eight-year agreement (through 2021 season).\n\nThe Quick Lane, Armed Forces and Heart of Dallas Bowls will select a bowl-eligible Big Ten team, subject to conference approval.\n<ref>http://grfx.cstv.com/photos/schools/big10/sports/m-footbl/auto_pdf/2014-15/misc_non_event/Bowl_Determination_Procedures.pdf</ref>\n\n===Head coach compensation===\nThe total pay of head coaches includes university and non-university compensation.

Permanent matches were as follows:{{Citation needed|date=February 2014}}\n* '''Illinois''': Indiana, Northwestern\n* '''Indiana''': Illinois, Purdue\n* '''Iowa''': Minnesota, Wisconsin\n* '''Michigan''': Michigan State, Ohio State\n* '''Michigan State''': Michigan, Penn State\n* '''Minnesota''': Iowa, Wisconsin\n* '''Northwestern''': Illinois, Purdue\n* '''Ohio State''': Michigan, Penn State\n* '''Penn State''': Michigan State, Ohio State\n* '''Purdue''': Indiana, Northwestern\n* '''Wisconsin''': Iowa, Minnesota\n\nThis system was discontinued after the 2010 season, as teams became grouped into two divisions, and would play all teams in their division once, with one protected cross-over game, and two games rotating against the other five opponents from the opposing division.\n\nMost of the above permanent rivalries were maintained. By virtue of the new alignment, a handful of new permanent divisional opponents were created, as all pairs of teams within the same division would face off each season. Furthermore, three new permanent inter-divisional matches resulted from the realignment: Purdue–Iowa, Michigan State–Indiana, and Penn State–Nebraska. The following past permanent matches were maintained across divisions: Minnesota–Wisconsin, Michigan–Ohio State, and Illinois–Northwestern.\n\nThe new alignment, however, caused some of the above permanent rivalries to be discontinued. These were: Iowa–Wisconsin, Northwestern–Purdue, and Michigan State–Penn State. These matchups would continue to be played, but only twice every five years on average. More rivalries were disrupted, and some resumed on a yearly basis, when the league realigned into East and West Divisions for the 2014 season with the addition of Maryland and Rutgers. The two new schools were placed in the new East Division with Penn State, and the two Indiana schools were divided (Indiana to the East and Purdue to the West). With the move to a nine-game conference schedule in 2016, all cross-division games will be held at least once in a four-year cycle except for Indiana–Purdue, which is the only protected cross-division game.<ref name=\"2014 realignment approved\"/> The conference later announced that once the new scheduling format takes effect in 2016, members will be prohibited from playing [[Football Championship Subdivision|FCS]] teams, and required to play at least one non-conference game against a team in the [[Power Five conferences]] ([[Atlantic Coast Conference|ACC]], [[Big 12 Conference|Big 12]], [[Pac-12 Conference|Pac-12]] and [[Southeastern Conference|SEC]]; presumably, this would also allow for non-conference games against Big Ten opponents that are not on the conference schedule). Games against [[NCAA Division I FBS independent schools|independents]] [[Notre Dame Fighting Irish football|Notre Dame]] (an ACC member in non-football sports) and [[BYU Cougars football|BYU]] will also count toward the Power Five requirement.<ref name=\"McGuire\"/>\n\n===Intra-Conference basketball rivalries===\n* '''Illinois''': Indiana, Northwestern\n* '''Indiana''': Illinois, Purdue\n* '''Iowa''': Minnesota, Wisconsin\n* '''Michigan''': Michigan State, Ohio State \n* '''Michigan State''': Ohio State, Wisconsin, Michigan\n* '''Minnesota''': Iowa, Wisconsin\n* '''Northwestern''': Illinois, Purdue\n* '''Ohio State''': Michigan, Penn State, Michigan State\n* '''Penn State''': Ohio State\n* '''Purdue''': Indiana, Northwestern\n* '''Wisconsin''': Iowa, Minnesota\n\n===Extra-Conference basketball rivalries===\n* '''Illinois''': Missouri\n* '''Indiana''': Kentucky\n* '''Iowa''': Drake, Iowa State, Northern Iowa\n* '''Maryland''': Duke, Virginia, Georgetown\n* '''Michigan''': Duke\n* '''Nebraska''': Creighton\n* '''Penn State''': Bucknell, Pittsburgh\n* '''Rutgers''': Princeton, Seton Hall\n* '''Wisconsin''': Marquette\n\n===Other sports===\n\n====Men's ice hockey====\n* Michigan–Michigan State ([[Michigan–Michigan State ice hockey rivalry|Michigan–Michigan State rivalry]])\n* Minnesota–Wisconsin ([[Border Battle (Minnesota–Wisconsin)|Border Battle]])\n* Minnesota–North Dakota\n* Minnesota–Minnesota Duluth\n* Minnesota-St. Cloud State\n\n====Men's lacrosse====\n* Maryland–Johns Hopkins ([[Johns Hopkins–Maryland rivalry]])\n* Penn State–Bucknell\n* Rutgers–Princeton\n\n====Men's soccer====\n* Michigan–Michigan State ([[Big Bear Trophy]])\n\n====Wrestling====\n* Penn State–Lehigh\n* Iowa–Iowa State\n* Iowa–Oklahoma State\n\n===Extra-conference rivalries===\nThree Big Ten teams—Purdue, Michigan State and Michigan—had rivalries in football with [[Notre Dame Fighting Irish football rivalries|Notre Dame]]. After the University of Southern California with 35 wins (including a vacated 2005 win), the Michigan State Spartans have the most wins against the Irish, with 28. The Purdue Boilermakers follow with 26, and Michigan ranks fourth all-time with 24.\n\nPenn State has a longstanding [[Pitt–Penn State rivalry|rivalry]] with [[Pittsburgh Panthers football|Pittsburgh]] of the [[Atlantic Coast Conference|ACC]], but the two schools did not meet from 2000 until renewing the rivalry with an alternating home-and-home series from 2016 to 2019. Penn State also has long histories with independent [[Notre Dame Fighting Irish football|Notre Dame]]; [[Temple Owls football|Temple]] of [[American Athletic Conference|The American]]; [[Syracuse Orange football|Syracuse]], and [[Boston College Eagles football|Boston College]] of the ACC; and [[West Virginia Mountaineers football|West Virginia]], of the [[Big 12 Conference]]. Additionally, Penn State maintains strong intrastate rivalries with [[Patriot League]] universities [[Bucknell Bison|Bucknell]] in men's basketball and men's lacrosse, and [[Lehigh Mountain Hawks|Lehigh]] in wrestling. Most of these rivalries were cultivated while Penn State operated independent of conference affiliation; the constraints of playing a full conference schedule, especially in football, have reduced the number of meetings between Penn State and its non-Big Ten rivals.\n\nIowa has an in-state rivalry with [[Iowa State Cyclones|Iowa State]] of the Big 12, with the winner getting the [[Cy-Hawk Trophy]] in football. Iowa and Iowa State also compete annually in the [[Hy-Vee Cy-Hawk Series|Cy-Hawk Series]] sponsored by Hy-Vee (as of 2011 this series is now sponsored by The Iowa Corngrowers Association), the competition includes all head-to-head regular season competitions in all sports. Iowa also holds rivalries in basketball with the state's other two Division I programs, [[Drake Bulldogs|Drake]] and [[Northern Iowa Panthers|Northern Iowa]].\n\nIndiana has an out-of-conference rivalry with [[Kentucky Wildcats|Kentucky]] of the [[Southeastern Conference|SEC]] (see [[Indiana–Kentucky rivalry]]). While the two schools played in football for many years, the rivalry was rooted in their decades of national success in men's basketball. The two no longer play one another in football, but their basketball rivalry continued until a dispute about game sites ended the series after 2011. In the last season of the rivalry (2011–12), the teams played twice. During the regular season, then-unranked [[2011–12 Indiana Hoosiers men's basketball team|Indiana]] defeated then-#1 ranked [[2011–12 Kentucky Wildcats men's basketball team|Kentucky]] 73–72 at Assembly Hall. The Wildcats avenged the loss in the NCAA tournament, defeating Indiana 102–90 in the South Regional final in [[Georgia Dome|Atlanta]] on their way to a national title. The teams next played in the 2016 NCAA tournament, with Indiana winning.\n\nIllinois has a longstanding basketball rivalry with the [[Southeastern Conference|SEC]]'s [[Missouri Tigers men's basketball|Missouri Tigers]], with the two men's teams squaring off annually in the \"[[Braggin' Rights]]\" game. It has been held in [[St. Louis]] since 1980, first at the [[St. Louis Arena]] and since 1994 at the [[Scottrade Center]]. This rivalry has been carried over into football as \"The Arch Rivalry\" with games played at the [[Edward Jones Dome]] in St. Louis in 2002 and 2003 and four games in 2007 through 2010.[https://web.archive.org/web/20070309010901/http://www.stlouissports.org/pressbox/releases/missouriillinois82505.php]\n\nWisconsin has a long-standing in-state basketball rivalry with [[Marquette Golden Eagles men's basketball|Marquette]]. The series has intensified as of late with both teams having made the [[NCAA Division I Men's Basketball Championship|Final Four]] in recent years. The schools also played an annual football game before Marquette abandoned its football program in 1961. The school also has minor rivalries in basketball with the two other Division I members of the [[University of Wisconsin System]], which include the [[Milwaukee Panthers|University of Wisconsin–Milwaukee]] and [[Green Bay Phoenix|University of Wisconsin–Green Bay]].\n\nMinnesota men's ice hockey has a prolific and fierce border rivalry with the University of North Dakota. The two teams played annually between 1948 and 2013 as members of the [[Western Collegiate Hockey Association]] prior to the inception of the Big Ten Conference. The rivalry will resume in 2016 in non-conference action.\n\nIn the early days of the Big Ten, the [[Chicago Maroons football|Chicago]]&ndash;[[Michigan Wolverines football|Michigan]] game was played on [[Thanksgiving (United States)|Thanksgiving]], usually with conference championship implications and was considered one of the first major rivalries of the conference. See [[Chicago–Michigan football rivalry]].\n\nAlso in the early days of the conference, and at [[Knute Rockne]]'s insistence, [[Northwestern Wildcats football|Northwestern]] and [[Notre Dame Fighting Irish football|Notre Dame]] had a yearly contest, with the winner taking home a [[shillelagh (weapon)|shillelagh]], much like the winner of the [[USC Trojans football|USC]]–Notre Dame and Purdue–Notre Dame contests now receive. The Northwestern–Notre Dame shillelagh was largely forgotten by the early 1960s and is now solely an element of college football's storied past.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://hailtopurple.com/features/trophyhistory.html |title=History of NU's Rivalry Trophies |publisher=HailToPurple.com |date= |accessdate=2012-11-07}}</ref>\n\n==Facilities==\nThe Big Ten is second to the [[Southeastern Conference]] (SEC) in football stadiums that seat over 100,000, with the Big Ten having three to the SEC's four. The Big Ten's 100,000-seat stadiums are Beaver Stadium, Michigan Stadium, and Ohio Stadium. Only five other college football stadium have such a capacity: [[Texas A&M Aggies football|Texas A&M's]] [[Kyle Field]], [[Neyland Stadium]] at the [[Tennessee Volunteers football|University of Tennessee]], [[Bryant–Denny Stadium]] of the [[Alabama Crimson Tide football|University of Alabama]] and [[LSU Tigers football|LSU's]] [[Tiger Stadium (LSU)|Tiger Stadium]] in the SEC, and [[Darrell K Royal–Texas Memorial Stadium]] at the [[Texas Longhorns football|University of Texas at Austin]] in the [[Big 12 Conference]]. The three stadiums are three of the four largest football stadiums in the [[List of American football stadiums by capacity|United States]], as well as the third, fourth, and seventh [[List of stadiums by capacity|largest sports stadiums in the world]].\n\nThe Big Ten is home to two of the top-10 largest on-campus basketball arenas in the country: Ohio State's [[Value City Arena]] and Maryland's [[Xfinity Center (College Park, Maryland)|Xfinity Center]]. Additionally, arenas at Indiana, Wisconsin, Illinois, Iowa, and Penn State rank among the top-20 largest on-campus basketball facilities in the United States. The Big Ten Conference features more on-campus basketball arenas with seating capacities of 15,000 or more than any other conference in the country.\n\n===Football, basketball, and baseball facilities===\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n!School\n!Football stadium\n!Capacity\n!Basketball arena\n!Capacity\n!Baseball stadium\n!Capacity\n|-\n|'''[[Illinois Fighting Illini|Illinois]]'''\n|[[Memorial Stadium (Champaign)|Memorial Stadium]]\n|60,670\n|[[State Farm Center]]\n|16,618\n|[[Illinois Field]]\n|3,000\n|-\n|'''[[Indiana Hoosiers|Indiana]]'''\n|[[Memorial Stadium (Indiana)|Memorial Stadium]]\n|52,929\n|[[Simon Skjodt Assembly Hall]]\n|17,357\n|[[Bart Kaufman Field]]\n|2,500\n|-\n|'''[[Iowa Hawkeyes|Iowa]]'''\n|[[Kinnick Stadium]]\n|70,585\n|[[Carver–Hawkeye Arena]]\n|15,400\n|[[Duane Banks Field]]\n|3,000\n|-\n|'''[[Maryland Terrapins|Maryland]]'''\n| [[Maryland Stadium|Capital One Field at Maryland Stadium]]\n| 51,802\n| [[Xfinity Center (College Park, Maryland)|Xfinity Center]]\n| 17,950\n| [[Shipley Field]]\n| 2,500\n|-\n|'''[[Michigan Wolverines|Michigan]]'''\n|[[Michigan Stadium]]\n|107,601\n|[[Crisler Center]]\n|12,707\n|[[Ray Fisher Stadium]]\n|4,000\n|-\n|'''[[Michigan State Spartans|Michigan State]]'''\n|[[Spartan Stadium (East Lansing)|Spartan Stadium]]\n|75,005\n|[[Breslin Student Events Center]]\n|14,797\n|[[Drayton McLane Baseball Stadium at John H.

Matheson (Utah governor)|Scott M. Matheson]], the goal of the festival was to showcase strictly American-made films, highlight the potential of independent film, and to increase visibility for filmmaking in Utah. At the time, the main focus of the event was to conduct a competition for independent American films, present a series of retrospective films and filmmaker panel discussions, and to celebrate the [[Frank Capra]] Award. The festival also highlighted the work of regional filmmakers who worked outside the [[Hollywood]] system.\n\nThe jury of the 1978 festival was headed by [[Charles Gary Allison|Gary Allison]], and included [[Verna Fields]], [[Linwood G. Dunn]], [[Katharine Ross]], [[Charles Sellier|Charles E. Sellier Jr.]], [[Mark Rydell]], and [[Anthea Sylbert]].\n\nIn 1979, Sterling Van Wagenen left to head up the first-year pilot program of what was to become the [[Sundance Institute]], and James W. (Jim) Ure took over briefly as executive director, followed by Cirina Hampton Catania as executive director. More than 60 films were screened at the festival that year, and panels featured many well-known Hollywood filmmakers. Also that year, the first Frank Capra Award went to [[Jimmy Stewart]]. The festival also made a profit for the first time. In 1980, Catania left the festival to pursue a production career in Hollywood.\n\nSeveral factors helped propel the growth of Utah/US Film Festival. First was the involvement of actor and Utah resident Robert Redford, who became the festival's inaugural chairman. By having Redford's name associated with the festival, it received great attention. Secondly, the country was hungry for more venues that would celebrate American-made films as the only other festival doing so at the time was the [[USA Film Festival]] in [[Dallas]] (est. 1971). Response in Hollywood was unprecedented, as major studios did all they could to contribute their resources.\n\nIn 1981, the festival moved to Park City, Utah, and changed the dates from September to January. The move from late summer to midwinter was done by the executive director Susan Barrell with the cooperation of Hollywood director [[Sydney Pollack]], who suggested that running a film festival in a ski resort during winter would draw more attention from Hollywood. It was called the US Film and Video Festival.\n\n=== Change to Sundance ===\nIn 1984, the now well-established Sundance Institute, headed by Sterling Van Wagenen, took over management of the US Film Festival. Gary Beer and Van Wagenen spearheaded production of the inaugural US Film Festival presented by Sundance Institute (1985), which included Program Director Tony Safford and Administrative Director Jenny Walz Selby. The branding and marketing transition from the US Film Festival to the Sundance Film Festival was managed under the direction of Colleen Allen, Allen Advertising Inc., by appointment of Robert Redford.  In 1991, the festival was officially renamed the Sundance Film Festival, after Redford's character [[the Sundance Kid]] from the film ''[[Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid]]''.<ref>{{cite web |first=Lauren David |last=Peden |title=Sundance Subdued |url=http://www.coastmagazine.com/archive/pre_dec05/travel_sundance.html |date=December 2005 |publisher=Freedom Orange County Information (coastmagazine.com) |accessdate=2007-11-11 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927202623/http://www.coastmagazine.com/archive/pre_dec05/travel_sundance.html <!-- Bot retrieved archive --> |archivedate=2007-09-27}}</ref>\n\n===Sundance London===\n{{Update|inaccurate=yes|section|date=October 2012}}\nUK-based publisher C21 Media first revealed in October 2010 that Robert Redford was planning to bring the Sundance Film Festival to London,<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.c21media.net/archives/51050|title=Exclusive: Redford plans London Sundance|first=Adam|last=Benzine|newspaper=C21 Media|date=October 7, 2010|accessdate=May 29, 2013}}</ref> and in March the following year, Redford officially announced that Sundance London would be held at [[The O2]], in London from 26–29 April 2012; the first time it has traveled outside the [[United States|US]].<ref name=\"Farmer 2012\">{{cite news|url=http://www.theo2.co.uk/general/robert-redford-sundance-institute-and-aeg-europe-launch-sundance-at-t.html|title=Robert Redford, Sundance Institute And Aeg Europe Launch Sundance London At The O2|first=Stephen|last=Farmer|newspaper=[[AEG Worldwide]]|date=October 2012|accessdate=2012-10-22}}</ref>\n\nIn a press statement, Redford said, \"We are excited to partner with [[Anschutz Entertainment Group|AEG Europe]] to bring a particular slice of American culture to life in the inspired setting of The O2, and in this city of such rich cultural history.

The festival is also responsible for bringing wider attention to such films as ''[[Saw (2004 film)|Saw]]'', ''[[Garden State (film)|Garden State]]'', ''[[Super Troopers]]'', ''[[The Blair Witch Project]]'', ''[[Spanking the Monkey]]'', ''[[Reservoir Dogs]]'', ''[[Primer (film)|Primer]]'', ''[[In the Bedroom]]'', ''[[Better Luck Tomorrow]]'', ''[[Little Miss Sunshine]]'', ''[[Donnie Darko]]'', ''[[El Mariachi]]'', ''[[Moon (film)|Moon]]'', ''[[Clerks]]'', ''[[Thank You for Smoking (film)|Thank You for Smoking]]'', ''[[Sex, Lies, and Videotape]]'', ''[[The Brothers McMullen]]'', ''[[(500) Days of Summer]]'', ''[[Napoleon Dynamite]]'', ''[[Whiplash (2014 film)|Whiplash]], [[Boyhood (film)|Boyhood]],'' and ''[[Get Out]]''.\n\n''[[Three Seasons]]'' was the first in festival history to ever receive both the Grand Jury Award and Audience Award, in 1999.

Festival organizers have tried curbing these activities in recent years, beginning in 2007 with their ongoing Focus On Film campaign.\n\nThe 2009 film ''Official Rejection'' documented the experience of small filmmakers trying to get into various festivals in the late 2000s, including Sundance. The film contained several arguments that Sundance had become dominated by large studios and sponsoring corporations. A contrast was made between the 1990s, in which non-famous filmmakers with tiny budget films could get distribution deals from studios like [[Miramax Films]] or [[New Line Cinema]], (like [[Kevin Smith]]'s ''Clerks''), and the 2000s, when major stars with multimillion-dollar films (like ''The Butterfly Effect'' with [[Ashton Kutcher]]) dominated the festival. Kevin Smith doubted that ''Clerks'', if made in the late 2000s, would be accepted to Sundance.<ref>Kevin Smith, interviewed in ''Official Rejection'', documentary film, 2009, directed by Paul Osborne</ref>\n\nNumerous small festivals sprung up around Sundance in the Park City area, including [[Slamdance Film Festival|Slamdance]], [[Nodance Film Festival|Nodance]], [[Slumdance Film Festival|Slumdance]], It-dance, X-Dance, [[Lapdance]], [[Tromadance]], The [[Park City Film Music Festival]], etc., though all except{{citation needed|date=February 2017}} Slamdance are no longer held.<ref>''Official Rejection'', documentary film, 2009, directed by Paul Osborne</ref>\n\nIncluded in the Sundance changes made in 2010, a new programming category titled \"NEXT\" (often denoted simply by the characters \"<=>\", which mean \"less is more\") was introduced to showcase innovative films that are able to transcend the confines of an independent budget. Another recent addition was the Sundance Film Festival USA program, in which eight of the festival's films are shown in eight different theaters around the United States.<ref>{{cite news |date=January 22, 2010 |first=Cody |last=Clark |title=Redford launches 2010 Sundance Film Festival in Park City |url=http://heraldextra.com/news/local/article_38fab10a-0120-5c9a-bec2-b0c13dc56df8.html |newspaper=[[The Daily Herald (Utah)|The Daily Herald]] |accessdate=2010-01-22}}</ref>\n\n=== Directors ===\n* Geoff Gilmore – 1991–2009<ref>{{cite web\n|first=Jeremy\n|last=Kay\n|url=http://www.screendaily.com/john-cooper-steps-up-as-director-of-sundance-film-festival/4043584.article\n|title=John Cooper steps up as director of Sundance Film Festival\n|date=11 March 2009\n|publisher=ScreenDaily.com\n|accessdate=2010-01-31\n|subscription=yes\n}}</ref><ref>{{cite news\n|first=Michael\n|last=Cieply\n|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/02/18/movies/18tribeca.html\n|title=Shakeup in Film Festivals as a Familiar Face Moves\n|date=17 February 2009\n|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]\n|accessdate=2010-01-31\n}}</ref>\n* John Cooper – 2009–present<ref>\n{{cite press release\n|publisher=Sundance Institute\n|url=http://www.sundance.org/pdf/2009-03-09-cooper.pdf\n|format=pdf\n|title=Sundance Institute announces John Cooper as Director, Sundance Film Festival\n|date=11 March 2009\n|accessdate=2010-01-31\n}}</ref>\n\n== In popular culture ==\nIn August 1998, the animated television series ''[[South Park]]'' episode \"[[Chef's Chocolate Salty Balls]]\" depicts the directors of the Sundance Festival moving it to a \"different small mountain town,\" that of the show's main setting South Park, in order to \"drain it and morph it into a new [[Los Angeles|LA]].\"\n\nIn the episode \"[[Hollywood A.D.]]\" of [[X-Files|''The X-Files'']], [[Fox Mulder]] is relieved that the fictitious movie ''The Lazarus Bowl'' about his work will never be screened at the Sundance Festival.\n\nIn the television series ''[[Entourage (U.S. TV series)|Entourage]]'', one of the independent movies that [[Vincent Chase]] stars in (''Queens Boulevard'') premieres at the 2005 Sundance Film Festival, where it begins to gain in popularity.\n\nIn the animated television series ''[[The Simpsons]]'' \"[[Any Given Sundance]]\" episode, [[Lisa Simpson]] enters a documentary about her family into the Sundance Film Festival.\n\nIn Season 7, Episode 22 of ''[[One Tree Hill (TV series)|One Tree Hill]]'', [[List of One Tree Hill characters#Julian Baker|Julian Baker]] takes his film ''Seven Dreams Till Tuesday'' to the festival.\n\nReferenced in Season 3, Episode 12 of ''[[Gilmore Girls]]'' when [[Paris Geller]] tells [[Rory Gilmore]] to \"save her act for Sundance.\"\n\n== See also ==\n* [[List of Sundance Film Festival award winners]]\n* [[List of Sundance Film Festival selections]]\n* [[Sundance Channel (United States)|Sundance Channel]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n==Further reading==\n* Anderson, John.
