A [[solar eclipse]] occurs when the [[Moon]] passes between [[Earth]] and the [[Sun]], thereby totally or partly obscuring the image of the Sun for a viewer on Earth. A partial solar eclipse occurs in the polar regions of the Earth when the center of the Moon's shadow misses the Earth.\n== Related eclipses ==\n\n=== Solar eclipses of 1964-1967===\n{{Solar eclipse set 1964-1967}}\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n{{commons category|Solar eclipse of 1967 May 9}}\n\n== External links ==\n{{Solar eclipse NASA reference|1951/SE1967May09P|19670509}}\n\n{{Solar eclipses}}\n\n[[Category:1967 in science]]\n[[Category:20th-century solar eclipses|1967 5 9]]\n[[Category:May 1967 events]]\n\n\n{{Solar-eclipse-stub}}"

Sedan's effects were similar to shot \"George\" of [[Operation Tumbler–Snapper]], detonated on June 1, 1952, which also contributed about 7% to the total radioactive fallout. Uncertainty regarding exact amounts of exposure prevents knowing which of the two nuclear tests caused the most; George is listed as being the highest exposure and Sedan second highest by the [[United States Department of Health and Human Services]], [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]], and the [[National Cancer Institute]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.cdc.gov/nceh/radiation/fallout/feasibilitystudy/Technical_Vol_1_FrontMatter.pdf|title=''Report on the Feasibility of a Study of the Health Consequences to the American Population from Nuclear Weapons Tests Conducted by the United States and Other Nations'', Vol 1.

Proposed applications included the creation of harbors, canals, open pit mines, railroad and highway cuts through mountainous terrain and the construction of dams. Assessment of the full effects of the Sedan shot showed that the radioactive fallout from such uses would be extensive. Public concerns about the health effects and a lack of political support eventually led to abandonment of the concept.<ref>[http://www.cddc.vt.edu/host/atomic/atmosphr/ustests.html#Plowshare Center for Digital Discourse and Culture, Virginia Tech.

However, the name \"Sedan\" was incorrectly transcribed as \"[[Sudan]]\" in the [[Congressional Record]].\n\nWithin days of the error, the international community took notice.
