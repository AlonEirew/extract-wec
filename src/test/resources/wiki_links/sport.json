[[National Basketball Association]] (NBA) teams took turns selecting amateur U.S. [[college basketball]] players and other eligible players, including international players.\n\nThe [[NBA draft lottery|draft lottery]] took place during the playoffs on May 16, 2017. The 53–29 [[Boston Celtics]], who were also the #1 seed in the [[Eastern Conference (NBA)|Eastern Conference]] and reached the [[2017 NBA Playoffs|Eastern Conference Finals]] at the time of the NBA draft lottery, won the #1 pick with pick swapping rights thanks to a previous trade with the [[Brooklyn Nets]], who had the worst record the previous season. The [[Los Angeles Lakers]], who had risked losing their 2017 first round pick to the [[Philadelphia 76ers]], moved up two spots to get the No. 2 pick, while Philadelphia moved up to receive the No. 3 pick due to the [[Sacramento Kings]] moving up in the draft, which activated pick swapping rights the 76ers had from an earlier trade. On June 19, four days before the NBA draft began, the Celtics and 76ers traded their top first round picks to each other, meaning the holders of the top four picks of this year's draft would be exactly the same as the previous year's draft.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.celticsblog.com/2017/6/19/15831962/nba-draft-celtics-officially-trade-number-one-pick-to-76ers-philadelphia-boston-fultz-tatum|title=NBA Draft: Celtics officially trade number-one pick to 76ers|publisher=|accessdate=June 23, 2017}}</ref>\n\nThe draft class is the youngest draft class ever, with the most freshmen and fewest seniors selected in the first round; the top seven picks in the draft were all college freshmen. It was the third time, and the second in a row, that three players were selected from [[Serbia]]n team [[KK Mega Basket]] in the same draft ([[Vlatko Čančar]], [[Ognjen Jaramaz]], [[Alpha Kaba]]), with it previously occurring during the [[2014 NBA draft|2014]] and [[2016 NBA draft]].

The CBA that ended the [[2011 NBA Lockout|2011 lockout]] instituted no immediate changes to the draft, but called for a committee of owners and players to discuss future changes.\n\n* All drafted players must be at least 19 years old during the calendar year of the draft. In terms of dates, players who are eligible for the 2017 draft, must be born on or before December 31, 1998.\n* On January 13, 2016, the [[NCAA Division I]] council approved a new rule for that division that significantly changed the draft landscape for college players:<ref>{{cite news|url=http://espn.go.com/mens-college-basketball/story/_/id/14564613/date-nba-draft-commitment-pushed-may |title=College players given extra time to mull NBA draft decision |first=Jeff |last=Goodman |publisher=''ESPN.com'' |date=January 13, 2016 |accessdate=January 13, 2016}}</ref>\n** Declaration for the draft no longer results in automatic loss of college eligibility. As long as a player does not sign a contract with a professional team outside the NBA, or sign with an agent, he will retain college eligibility as long as he makes a timely withdrawal from the draft.\n** NCAA players now have until 10 days after the end of the [[NBA Draft Combine]] to withdraw from the draft. Since the combine is held in mid-May, the current deadline is about five weeks after the previous mid-April deadline.\n** NCAA players may participate in the draft combine, and will also be allowed to attend one tryout per year with each NBA team without losing college eligibility.\n** NCAA players may now enter and withdraw from the draft up to two times without loss of eligibility. Previously, the NCAA treated a second declaration of draft eligibility as a permanent loss of college eligibility.\n\nThe NBA has since expanded the draft combine to include players with remaining college eligibility (who, like players without college eligibility, can only attend by invitation).<ref>{{cite news|url=http://espn.go.com/mens-college-basketball/story/_/id/13142145/ncaa-proposes-new-nba-draft-rule-allow-underclassmen-return-school |title=NCAA proposes new NBA draft rule to allow early entrants back in school |first=Andy |last=Katz |authorlink=Andy Katz |publisher=''ESPN.com'' |date=June 24, 2015 |accessdate=June 24, 2015}}</ref>\n\n===Early entrants===\nPlayers who are not automatically eligible had to declare their eligibility for the draft by notifying the NBA offices in writing no later than 60 days before the draft. For the 2017 draft, this date fell on April 23. After that date \"early entry\" players were able to attend NBA pre-draft camps and individual team workouts to show off their skills and obtain feedback regarding their draft positions. Under the CBA a player may withdraw his name from consideration from the draft at any time before the final declaration date, which is 10 days before the draft. Under current NCAA rules, players have until May 24 (10 days after the draft combine) to withdraw from the draft and retain college eligibility.\n\nA player who has hired an agent forfeits his remaining college eligibility regardless of whether he is drafted.\n\n====College underclassmen====\nA record-high 185 underclass draft prospects (i.e., players with remaining college eligibility) had declared themselves for eligibility at the April 24 deadline (138 of them being from college), although college players who had not hired agents or signed professional contracts outside the NBA were able to decide to return to college by May 24, 10 days after the end of the [[NBA Draft Combine]]. These players have publicly indicated that they have hired agents, or had planned to do so around the start of the draft; those who hired agents immediately lost their eligibility to return to NCAA basketball in 2017–18.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.nba.com/article/2017/04/25/nba-announces-early-entry-candidates-2017-nba-draft |title=NBA announces early entry candidates for 2017 NBA Draft |accessdate=May 18, 2017}}</ref> By the end of the May 24 deadline, 73 draft candidates from college decided to return to their respective colleges for at least another year, leaving 64 underclassmen to officially enter the draft this year.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nba.com/article/2017/05/25/nba-announces-early-entry-candidates-withdraw-2017-nba-draft|title=NBA announces early entry candidates withdraw for 2017 NBA Draft|first=Official|last=release|website=NBA.com|accessdate=June 23, 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://nba.nbcsports.com/2017/05/25/after-73-underclassmen-pull-out-of-nba-draft-here-are-the-final-early-entries/|title=After 73 underclassmen pull out of NBA draft, here are the final early entries|first=Kurt|last=Helin|date=May 25, 2017|publisher=|accessdate=June 23, 2017}}</ref> Additionally, two more players left entry at the end of the international player deadline, meaning both [[Maverick Rowan]] from North Carolina State and [[Darin Johnson]] from Cal State Northridge would not return for college, but one player managed to enter the college underclassman deadline, thus leaving 63 entries at hand for the NBA Draft.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nba.com/article/2017/06/13/nba-draft-36-early-entry-international-candidates-withdraw|title=Thirty-six international early entry NBA Draft candidates withdraw|first=Official|last=release|website=NBA.com|accessdate=June 23, 2017}}</ref>\n\n{{Div col|colwidth=30em}}\n*{{flagicon|USA}} [[Bam Adebayo]] – F, [[Kentucky Wildcats men's basketball|Kentucky]] (freshman)\n*{{flagicon|USA}} [[Jarrett Allen]] – F, [[Texas Longhorns men's basketball|Texas]] (freshman)\n*{{flagicon|USA}} [[Ike Anigbogu]] – F, [[UCLA Bruins men's basketball|UCLA]] (freshman)\n*{{flagicon|ENG}}/{{flagicon|NGA}} [[OG Anunoby]] – F, [[Indiana Hoosiers men's basketball|Indiana]] (sophomore)\n*{{flagicon|USA}} [[Dwayne Bacon]] – G, [[Florida State Seminoles men's basketball|Florida State]] (sophomore)\n*{{flagicon|USA}} [[Lonzo Ball]] – G, [[UCLA Bruins men's basketball|UCLA]] (freshman)\n*{{flagicon|USA}} [[Jordan Bell]] – F, [[Oregon Ducks men's basketball|Oregon]] (junior)\n*{{flagicon|USA}} [[James Blackmon Jr.]] – G, [[Indiana Hoosiers men's basketball|Indiana]] (junior)\n*{{flagicon|USA}} [[Antonio Blakeney]] – G, [[LSU Tigers men's basketball|LSU]] (sophomore)\n*{{flagicon|USA}} [[Tony Bradley (basketball)|Tony Bradley]] – F, [[North Carolina Tar Heels men's basketball|North Carolina]] (freshman)\n*{{flagicon|USA}} [[Isaiah Briscoe]] – G, [[Kentucky Wildcats men's basketball|Kentucky]] (sophomore)\n*{{flagicon|CAN}} [[Dillon Brooks]] – F, [[Oregon Ducks men's basketball|Oregon]] (junior)\n*{{flagicon|USA}} [[Thomas Bryant (basketball)|Thomas Bryant]] – C, [[Indiana Hoosiers men's basketball|Indiana]] (sophomore)\n*{{flagicon|USA}} [[Clandell Cetoute]] – F, [[Thiel College]] (junior)\n*{{flagicon|USA}} [[John Collins (basketball)|John Collins]] – F, [[Wake Forest Demon Deacons men's basketball|Wake Forest]] (sophomore)\n*{{flagicon|USA}} [[Zach Collins]] – F/C, [[Gonzaga Bulldogs men's basketball|Gonzaga]] (freshman)\n*{{flagicon|USA}} [[Chance Comanche]] – C, [[Arizona Wildcats men's basketball|Arizona]] (sophomore)\n*{{flagicon|USA}}/{{flagicon|GRE}} [[Tyler Dorsey]] – G, [[Oregon Ducks men's basketball|Oregon]] (sophomore)\n*{{flagicon|USA}} [[P.

The final was contested by [[Germany national football team|Germany]] and [[Brazil national football team|Brazil]]. It was the first World Cup meeting between the two sides. Brazil won the match 2–0, winning a record fifth title. [[Ronaldo (Brazilian footballer)|Ronaldo]], who became the record World Cup goalscorer at the [[2006 FIFA World Cup|2006 tournament]], scored two of his fifteen World Cup goals in the second half of the match, leading Brazil to the title and winning the [[World Cup Golden Boot|Golden Boot]] award. It also marked Brazilian captain [[Cafu]]'s third consecutive appearance in a World Cup Final, a feat that has yet to be accomplished by any other player in the history of the tournament. Both teams had won their respective groups before advancing to the [[2002 FIFA World Cup knockout stage|knockout stage]], where Germany shut out all of their opponents to reach the final, while Brazil only allowed a single goal from [[England national football team|England]]. Germany overcame [[United States men's national soccer team|United States]] and co-host [[South Korea national football team|South Korea]], while Brazil knocked out England and Turkey.\n\nThe title marked Brazil's fifth World Cup championship, which is more than any other nation has achieved, also being the first team to win all seven of their games without any extra time or penalty kicks.

All of the cars were broken into two groups for practice. [[Marco Andretti]] set the fastest lap of the first session, and the fastest lap of the month at 228.318&nbsp;mph. No incidents were reported.\n* '''Qualifications summary'''\n:[[Ryan Briscoe]] was the first driver to make an attempt, turning a speed of 224.883&nbsp;mph, which suggested that speeds would be lower than those which had been achieved in the morning practice by [[Drafting (racing)|drafting]]. [[Danica Patrick]] later took over the provisional pole with a run over 225&nbsp;mph. [[Hélio Castroneves]] then pulled out of line in favor of going out later in the day. Spins involving [[A. J. Foyt IV]] and [[Bruno Junqueira]] did not cause any damage.\n\n:After 11 positions were filled, bumping began. [[Dan Wheldon]] took to the track, and knocked Patrick from the provisional pole.

He went out for his first attempt, but fell short of taking over the pole position. He did not rule out another attempt later in the day. At 3:34&nbsp;p.m. [[Ryan Briscoe]] became the first driver to withdraw his earlier speed, and attempt to re-qualify. He knocked Wheldon from the top spot, only to be knocked down to second moments later by [[Scott Dixon]].\n\n:The final hour concentrated largely on teams trying to bump their way into the top 11. [[Hideki Mutoh]] was successful, but [[Ryan Hunter-Reay]] crashed hard in turn 3. Former Champ Car entries [[Graham Rahal]], [[Will Power]] and [[Justin Wilson (racing driver)|Justin Wilson]] all fell short of the top 11. Meanwhile the [[Andretti Green Racing|AGR]] and [[Team Penske|Penske]] entries gave up on their efforts to secure the pole position, and pulled their cars out of line for the day. [[Dan Wheldon]] was the final driver to withdraw his speed and make a run for the pole. After two fast laps, his second two dropped off, and he settled for second position. When the gun sounded to close the track at 6:00&nbsp;p.m., [[Scott Dixon]] won his first [[List of Indianapolis 500 pole-sitters|Indianapolis 500 pole position]], and [[Chip Ganassi Racing]] secured their third Indy pole.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size:95%;\"\n|-\n|+ May 10, 2008 - Pole Day Qualifying Results\n|-\n!

[[Mario Dominguez]] wrecked in the first turn, his second crash of the month. Minutes later, [[Max Papis]] crashed hard in turn three. [[John Andretti]] led the speed chart at 224.027&nbsp;mph.\n* '''Qualifications summary'''\n:The third day of qualifications saw the field filled to 33 cars with [[Townsend Bell]] fastest of the day at 222.529&nbsp;mph. Two additional crashes, along with mechanical problems, however, altered the field of non-qualified cars.\n\n:Seventeen minutes into the qualifying session, after four cars had completed runs, a light rain shower halted track activity for 15&nbsp;minutes. [[Oriol Servia]], who was on the track when the rain fell, was allowed to re-attempt without penalty. Several former [[Champ Car]] drivers including [[Graham Rahal]], [[Justin Wilson (racing driver)|Justin Wilson]], and [[Will Power]] all qualified safely.\n\n:For the second time in Indy history, three female drivers made the field, after [[Milka Duno]] and [[Sarah Fisher]] completed runs. A break in the qualifying line occurred around 2&nbsp;p.m., with former champion [[Buddy Lazier]] the slowest in the field, and only one spot remaining.\n\n:Just before 4&nbsp;p.m., [[Hideki Mutoh]] crashed his already-qualified car. On the exit of turn two, his car went high in the groove, and brushed along the wall part way down the backstretch. About 25&nbsp;minutes later, [[Phil Giebler]], in his first significant on-track laps, crashed hard in turn one. He was taken to [[Methodist Hospital of Indianapolis|Methodist Hospital]].\n\n:With less than 15&nbsp;minutes left in the day, [[A. J. Foyt IV]] and [[Marty Roth]] looked to make their way into the field. Foyt suffered a gearbox failure during his warm-up lap, and returned to the pits. Roth immediately went out and filled the final qualifying spot, albeit as the slowest overall in the field. Foyt's [[Vision Racing|Vision]] crew scrambled to put the gearbox back together, in hopes of bumping into the field before the 6 o'clock gun. The team ran out of time, however, and was forced to wait until Sunday to make a qualifying attempt.\n\n{|class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size:95%;\"\n|-\n|+ May 17, 2008 - Third Day Qualifying Results\n|-\n!

Also spending time on the track were [[Marty Roth]], [[Buddy Lazier]], [[Mario Dominguez]], and [[Davey Hamilton]] who blew a motor late in the session.\n* '''Qualifications summary'''\n:Shortly after the track opened for time trials, [[A. J. Foyt IV]] easily bumped his way into the field, bumping [[Marty Roth]] in the process. Later in the afternoon, Roth was able to secure a spot by bumping [[Buddy Lazier]].\n\n:After qualifying, [[A. J. Foyt IV]] took his car out for practice. The fuel buckeye cover broke off after he exited the pits, and in turn three, a fire started on the side of the car, causing him to spin and crash into the wall. The car was heavily damaged. With [[Roger Yasukawa]] on the bubble, [[Mario Dominguez]] made his first attempt to qualify, but was too slow.\n\n:In the final half hour, the unqualified cars made their final attempts. [[Buddy Lazier]]'s first attempt was too slow, and his team waved off after three laps. [[Mario Dominguez]] made his second attempt, and was able to bump [[Roger Yasukawa]] from the field. Yasukawa was the next to go out, and missed bumping his way back into the field by 0.046&nbsp;seconds. [[Max Papis]] lined up to make an attempt, but lingering clutch problems prevented him from pulling out of the pits. With about 13&nbsp;minutes remaining, Lazier returned to the track after some adjustments, and found enough speed to bump Dominguez. Dominguez made one final attempt to make the field, taking the green flag just before the 6 o'clock gun. After one lap that was fast enough to bump [[Marty Roth]], he lost control and crashed in turn one. Roth and Lazier held on to make the field, while Papis was left waiting in line.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size:95%;\"\n|-\n|+ colspan=9|May 18, 2008 - Bump Day Qualifying Results\n|-\n!

The event took place on the [[IJsselmeer]] of [[Medemblik]], the [[Netherlands]], from 20 September to 27 September 2008.<ref>[http://www.ussailing.org/Calendar/results.asp?categoryid=All&Groups=All&Class=&FROM=9-20-2008&TO=9-27-2008&KEYWORD=Vintage&byOA=Search USSailing]</ref>\nA total of 66 sailors in 47 boats from 17 [[country|countries]] showed up to compete in six [[Former Olympic sailing classes|Vintage Yachting Classes]]\n\n== Prologue==\n\n=== Bid process===\nSince the idea of the Vintage Yachting Games originated from the Netherlands and also the key project team members where living there it was an easy step to organize this event the first time nearby. So there was no formal bid process. \nThe city of Medemblik is since the early 1960s the main capital of the Dutch Olympic sailing community. The IJsselmeer of the coast of Medemblik offers mostly fair conditions for racing. The Royal Yacht Club Hollandia, the primary race organizer in Medemblik, however turned down the request of the Vintage Yachting Games Organization to act as the host club. A perfect alternative was found  in the experienced [[Surf, Zeil & Watersportvereniging Uitdam]] and one of its founders [[Frans Bolweg]]. With Uitdam the Vintage Yachting Games Organization was ensured form a very professional host club with also many years of experience at the waters near the Medemblik coast. Uitdam co-organized for many years the successful [[SPA-regatta]] (currently [[Holland-regatta]] or [[Delta Lloyd Regatta]]).\n\n=== Kick-off and preparation===\nIn order to realize the first edition of the Vintage Yachting Games in time and with the proper quality, a project team was put together with competence in areas. Besides the Vintage Yachting Games Organizations board, the project team consisted of Frouk Segaar (Race management), Lydia Verduyn (Fundraising), Peter Hoekstra, Mireille Zeeman and Martijn van der Driest (Ceremonies), Menno Meyer (Jury), Robin Segaar (Measurement) and Frans Bolweg (Host club).\n[[File:Organizing Committee 2008 Vintage Yachting Games.JPG|thumb|Organizing Committee 2008 Vintage Yachting Games]]\n\nThe two main issues of the project team was confronted with were:\n* Getting the idea across to the class organizations and sailors\n* Fundraising , which turned out to be a very hard task\n\nBoth issues were emphasized by the fact that this was the first time ever of such an event. Finally issues were resolved in time by the project team so that the quality of the event was according to the required level.\n\n===Costs===\nThe financial strategy of the project team was that it must be able to organize a minimum event with high quality and finance it with the income of the entry fees. Funds and materials from sponsoring would be used to add quality elements to the event so that the sailors would get more value for money and the sponsors had more exposure a shore.\n\nThe total cost of the event was approximately € 40.000. Because at the last moment there was quite a significant number of no-shows, the project team successfully adjusted the purchase of social events, and some sponsors contributed extra so that the financial aspect of the event stayed (just) in the black.\n\n== Vintage ==\n\n=== Organization===\n{| class=\"table\"\n|-\n!\n!\n!\n!style=\"text-align:center\" |''Event management''\n!\n!\n!\n!\n|-\n|\n|\n|\n|style=\"text-align:center\" |Nancy Schoof <br> {{flagicon|Netherlands}} <br> Sebastian Hopf <br> {{flagicon|Germany}}\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|-\n|\n|style=\"text-align:center\" |'''Principal race officer'''\n|\n|style=\"text-align:center\" |'''Chief measurer'''\n|style=\"text-align:center\" colspan=\"5\"| '''Chairman of the jury'''\n|\n|\n|\n|-\n|\n|style=\"text-align:center\" |Frouk Segaar <br> {{flagicon|Netherlands}}\n|\n|style=\"text-align:center\" |John Best <br> {{flagicon|United Kingdom}}\n|style=\"text-align:center\" colspan=\"5\"| David Chivers <br> {{flagicon|United Kingdom}}\n|\n|\n|\n|-\n|style=\"text-align:center\" |''Race officer yellow area''\n|style=\"text-align:center\" |''Race officer orange area''\n|\n|style=\"text-align:center\" |''Measurer''\n|style=\"text-align:center\" colspan=\"5\"| ''Members of the jury''\n|\n|\n|\n|-\n|style=\"text-align:center\" |Michiel Pouli <br>{{flagicon|Netherlands}}\n|style=\"text-align:center\" |[[Frans Bolweg]] <br>{{flagicon|Netherlands}}\n|\n|style=\"text-align:center\" |Niki Nocke <br>{{flagicon|Germany}}\n|style=\"text-align:center\" |Menno Meyer <br>{{flagicon|Netherlands}}\n|style=\"text-align:center\" |Benno Loske <br>{{flagicon|Germany}}\n|style=\"text-align:center\" |Huib Ozinga <br>{{flagicon|Netherlands}}\n|style=\"text-align:center\" |Freddy Vergauwe <br>{{flagicon|Belgium}}\n|style=\"text-align:center\" |Cees Kurpershoek <br>{{flagicon|Netherlands}}\n|-\n|}\n\n=== Venues ===\n{{Infobox settlement\n| name                = Medemblik\n| native_name         =\n| native_name_lang    =\n| image_skyline       = Regatta Center Medemblik.png\n| image_caption       = Regatta Center Medemblik\n| image_flag          =\n| image_seal          =\n| image_shield        =\n| motto               =\n| image_map           = Venue of the 2008 Vintage Yachting Games Medemblik.jpg\n| map_caption         = Memory plaque at the Regatta Center\n| subdivision_type    = Country\n| subdivision_name    = [[Netherlands]]\n| subdivision_type1   = Province\n| subdivision_name1   = [[North Holland]]\n| subdivision_type2   =\n| subdivision_name2   =\n| pushpin_map_caption =\n| coordinates         = {{coord|52|46|18|N|5|7|4|E|region:NL|display=inline}}\n| founder             =\n| established_title   =\n| established_date    =\n| timezone1           =\n| iso_code            =\n| website             = http://www.medemblik.nl\n| footnotes           =\n| timezone            = [[Central European Time|CET]]\n| utc_offset          = +1\n| timezone_DST        = [[Central European Summer Time|CEST]]\n| utc_offset_DST      = +2\n}}\n\nThe Regatta Center in Medemblik offers suitable logistic and facilities for the organization of large International sailing events.

Felix was able to race due to the help of the Dutch O-Jolle class organization and [[Hendrik van Isselmuiden]] who lent out his O-Jolle.\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\nInformation about the Vintage Yachting Classes (former Olympic classes) can be verified by the:\n* International Olympic Committee: [http://www.olympics.org IOC]\n* International Sailing Federation: [http://www.sailing.org ISAF]\n* Newport Harbor Nautical Museum: [http://www.nhnm.org Newport Harbor Nautical Museum]\n* Nederlands Scheepvaartmuseum Amsterdam : [http://www.scheepvaartmuseum.nl Scheepvaartmuseum]\nand\n* {{cite book |title=Vintage Yachting Games,Olympic Classes|publisher=2008 Vintage Organizing Committee|location=Bergambacht|year=2008|ISBN=978-90-78440-23-9}}\nInformation about the organization, conditions, sailors and results can be verified by the:\n* Vintage Yachting Games Organization: [http://www.vintageyachtinggames.org Vintage Yachting Games]\n* International Europe Class Union: [http://www.europeclass.org Europe]\n* Olympiajolle Class Union: [http://www.o-jol.nl O-Jolle]\n* International Flying Dutchman Class Organization: [http://www.sailifdco.com Flying Dutchman]\n* International Soling Association: [http://www.soling.com Soling]\n* International Dragon Association: [http://www.intdragon.org Dragon]\n\n{{Vintage Yachting Games}}\n{{Olympic class sailboats}}\n\n[[Category:Vintage Yachting Games|2008]]\n[[Category:2008 in sailing|Vintage Yachting Games, 2008]]\n[[Category:2008 Vintage Yachting Games| ]]"

Chaminade's victory over a Virginia team that included three-time national player of the year [[Ralph Sampson]] has been called college basketball's \"biggest upset\" by multiple publications.<ref name=\"deadly\">{{cite journal|last=Fine|first=Happy|title=Very small but very deadly|journal=Sports Illustrated|date=January 10, 1983|url=https://www.si.com/vault/1983/01/10/627621/very-small-but-very-deadly|accessdate=July 10, 2016}}</ref><ref name=\"upset\">{{cite news|title=Chaminade's Win Was Unbelievable; Victory over Sampson, Virginia is game's No. 1 upset|work=Los Angeles Times|date=November 24, 2002|page=D1}}</ref>\n\n==Background==\nThe Cavaliers entered the Chaminade game with an 8–0 win–loss record in the 1982–83 NCAA Division I men's basketball season.

The Silverswords scored six of the game's first eight points, and continued to hold the advantage as the first half progressed. At one point they led 19–12, before a Cavaliers scoring run that gave Virginia a 22–21 lead. Despite the run, the Cavaliers had difficulty shooting field goals. Virginia forward Tim Mullen later said, \"I remember us getting like 10 rebounds per possession and missing layups. The ball would not go in.\"<ref name=\"seen\"/> At the end of the first half, the Cavaliers and the Silverswords were tied, 43–43.<ref name=\"deadly\"/>\n\nVirginia gained the lead early in the second half, and a [[Ricky Stokes]] score gave the Cavaliers a seven-point lead with 11:14 remaining. Chaminade responded with a 7–0 scoring run to force a 56–56 tie, before Sampson made a turnaround jump shot to give Virginia the lead back. Immediately after his basket, Sliverswords players Tim Dunham and Mark Rodrigues combined on an [[Alley-oop (basketball)|alley-oop]] play; Rodrigues passed the basketball to Dunham, who dunked over Sampson. Chaminade forward Richard Haenisch said of the basket, \"After that play, I think we all got the feeling we could actually win.\"<ref name=\"deadly\"/> With less than six minutes left in the second half, the teams were tied at 62–62.<ref name=\"seen\"/> Dunham made a 22-foot jumper to give the Silverswords the lead.<ref name=\"amazing\"/> The Cavaliers forced another tie at 68–68, only for Wells to make a layup with under two minutes on the game clock. Chaminade held a 74–72 lead with 35 seconds remaining, but Virginia gained possession of the basketball after the Silverswords missed a [[free throw]] attempt, which gave the Cavaliers an opportunity to tie the game. However, Virginia was unable to score during the possession; following three missed field goal attempts, Cavaliers player [[Othell Wilson]] committed a [[Carrying (basketball)|carrying]] violation with 10 seconds on the clock. After being fouled by the Cavaliers, Dunham was successful on two free throw attempts, stretching the Silverswords' lead to four points. Wells completed the scoring with another free throw, which made the final score 77–72 in Chaminade's favor.<ref name=\"seen\"/><ref name=\"amazing\"/>\n\nChaminade was led by Randolph; in 27 minutes on the court, he recorded 19 points with nine made field goals in 12 attempts, along with 5 rebounds.<ref name=\"amazing\"/> For the game, the Silverswords were successful on 28 of their 57 field goal attempts.

It was contested by the [[Eastern Conference (NHL)|Eastern Conference]] champion [[New Jersey Devils]] and the [[Western Conference (NHL)|Western Conference]] champion [[Detroit Red Wings]]. This was the first of nine consecutive finals with American-based franchises exclusively. New Jersey was making the franchise's first appearance in the Finals, while Detroit returned to the Finals for the first time since {{scfy|1966}} (and had not won since {{scfy|1955}}; both of those appearances had been against the [[Montreal Canadiens]]). The Devils swept the series four games to none to win their first [[Stanley Cup]], becoming the sixth team to earn a championship having joined the league in [[1967 NHL expansion|1967]] or later.\n\nDespite the fact that the regular season was cut severely short by the owners' [[1994–95 NHL lockout|lockout]], both the season and the finals were saved at the eleventh hour&ndash;this would be the latest in June that the Stanley Cup was awarded (matched in {{scfy|2013}}). The Devils won their first Stanley Cup, after 21 seasons and two franchise relocations. It was also the first of three for the Devils in less than a decade. The win was made more impressive by the fact that the Devils won it holding the lowest seed ever to win the Stanley Cup with the fifth seed, which remained the record until {{scfy|2012}}, another Final which not only involved the Devils, but also saw the Stanley Cup won by a team that did not have home ice advantage in any of the four rounds of the playoffs, as the Devils lost to the [[Los Angeles Kings]]. Their regular-season winning percentage was also the lowest since the {{scfy|1967}} [[Toronto Maple Leafs]]. They were the underdogs going in, winning their first two games on the road.\n\nThis series featured the two teams that have gone to the finals at least four times since the NHL renamed the conferences before the {{NHL Year|1993}} season. Including 1995, the Devils have been to the Finals five times, while the Red Wings have appeared in the Finals six times. It also marked the beginning of a series of wins the Devils, Red Wings, and [[Colorado Avalanche]] would establish in the era from 1995 to {{scfy|2003}}. The three teams would win a combined eight of nine Stanley Cups during that time. The Devils won it here, followed by the Avalanche in {{scfy|1996}}, then the Red Wings in {{scfy|1997}} and {{scfy|1998}}. After the [[Dallas Stars]] won in {{scfy|1999}}, the four-year cycle repeated as the Devils started it again in {{scfy|2000}}, followed by Colorado in {{scfy|2001}}, Detroit in {{scfy|2002}}, and the Devils themselves again in 2003.\n\n==Paths to the Finals==\n{{further|1995 Stanley Cup playoffs|1994–95 Detroit Red Wings season|1994–95 New Jersey Devils season}}\nTo get to the Final, New Jersey defeated the [[Boston Bruins]] 4–1, the [[Pittsburgh Penguins]] 4–1, and their [[Devils–Flyers rivalry|rival]] the [[Philadelphia Flyers]] 4–2.\n\nDetroit defeated the [[Dallas Stars]] 4–1, the [[San Jose Sharks]] 4–0, and [[Blackhawks–Red Wings rivalry|then division rival]] [[Chicago Blackhawks]] 4–1.\n\n==Game summaries==\n\n===Game one===\n{{IceHockeybox\n| date        = June 17\n| time        =\n| team1       = '''New Jersey Devils'''\n| team2       = Detroit Red Wings\n| score       = 2 – 1\n| periods     =\n| reference   = http://bigmouthsports.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/1995-Stanley-Cup-Playoff-boxscores-NJ.pdf\n| goalie1     = [[Martin Brodeur]] 16 saves / 18 shots\n| goalie2     = [[Mike Vernon (ice hockey)|Mike Vernon]] 19 saves / 23 shots\n| progression =\n| goals1      =\n| goals2      =  \n| official    = McCreary\n| linesman    =\n| linesman2   =\n| stadium     = [[Joe Louis Arena]]\n| attendance  =\n| penalties1  = \n| penalties2  = \n| shots1      =\n| shots2      =\n| note        =\n}}\n\nThe series opened on Saturday, June 17 at the Joe Louis Arena in [[Detroit, Michigan]]. Few gave New Jersey much of a chance against the NHL's best team. Going into the game, Detroit was a perfect 8–0 at home in the playoffs, and had outscored their opponents 30–11 in their eight home games. In the first three rounds alone the Red Wings had scored 18 power-play goals. Detroit fans, first greeting their opponents with a chorus of boos, then chanted after every Devils name was read during introductions, \"''Who cares?''\"\n\nAfter a scoreless first period, the underdog Devils got on the board first, when [[Stéphane Richer (ice hockey forward)|Stephane Richer]] blasted a slap shot from the top of the right circle that just squeezed through Detroit goaltender [[Mike Vernon (ice hockey)|Mike Vernon]]. The power-play goal came at 9:41 of the second period and gave New Jersey a 1–0 lead. The Red Wings responded less than four minutes later and tied the game on a power-play goal by [[Dino Ciccarelli]] at 13:08. The Devils would regain the lead on a goal by [[Claude Lemieux]], a slapper from the slot at 3:17 of the third period. New Jersey would go on to win the game 2–1 and take a one-game-to-none series lead. They played a solid defensive game, frustrating the Red Wings and holding them to just 17 shots. The win was their ninth road win of the playoffs.\n\n===Game two===\n{{IceHockeybox\n| date        = June 20\n| time        =\n| team1       = '''New Jersey Devils'''\n| team2       = Detroit Red Wings\n| score       = 4 – 2\n| periods     =\n| reference   = http://bigmouthsports.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/1995-Stanley-Cup-Playoff-boxscores-NJ.pdf\n| goalie1     = [[Martin Brodeur]] 16 saves / 18 shots\n| goalie2     = [[Mike Vernon (ice hockey)|Mike Vernon]] 19 saves / 23 shots\n| progression =\n| goals1      =\n| goals2      =\n| official    = Gregson\n| linesman    =\n| linesman2   =\n| stadium     = [[Joe Louis Arena]]\n| attendance  =\n| penalties1  = \n| penalties2  = \n| shots1      =\n| shots2      =\n| note        =\n}}\n\nIn game two, Detroit played with a sense of urgency. [[Vyacheslav Kozlov]] scored on the power play at 7:17 of the second period to make the score 1–0 in favor of the Red Wings. Devils forward [[John MacLean (ice hockey)|John MacLean]] would tie the game at 1–1 less than two and a half minutes later with a goal at 9:40. Then, on a Detroit breakaway, New Jersey defenceman and [[Captain (ice hockey)|captain]] [[Scott Stevens]] laid a thundering body check on Kozlov as he made a move to the inside past the New Jersey blue line. Although the Red Wings regained the lead on [[Sergei Fedorov]]'s goal at 1:36 of the third period, the Stevens hit seemed to inspire the Devils. With the midway point of the third period approaching, New Jersey defenceman [[Scott Niedermayer]] picked up the puck in his own zone and skated up the ice. Once over the Detroit blue line, he got a step on Detroit defenceman [[Paul Coffey]] and fired a shot towards the Detroit net. Although the puck missed the net, it bounced off the end boards and came right back to Niedermayer, who shot it past Mike Vernon to tie the game at 2–2. The game remained tied until late in the third period. Devils defenceman [[Shawn Chambers]] fired a shot from the point and the rebound came right to [[Jim Dowd (ice hockey)|Jim Dowd]] who backhanded the puck into the net to give the Devils a 3–2 lead. Stéphane Richer would add an empty-net goal as New Jersey won, 4–2.\n\n===Game three===\n{{IceHockeybox\n| date        = June 22\n| time        =\n| team1       = Detroit Red Wings\n| team2       = '''New Jersey Devils'''\n| score       = 2 – 5\n| periods     =\n| reference   = http://bigmouthsports.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/1995-Stanley-Cup-Playoff-boxscores-NJ.pdf\n| goalie1     = [[Mike Vernon (ice hockey)|Mike Vernon]]<br>[[Chris Osgood]] 26 saves / 31 shots\n| goalie2     = [[Martin Brodeur]] 22 saves / 24 shots\n| progression =\n| goals1      =\n| goals2      =\n| official    = Fraser\n| linesman    =\n| linesman2   =\n| stadium     = [[Brendan Byrne Arena]]\n| attendance  =\n| penalties1  = \n| penalties2  = \n| shots1      =\n| shots2      =\n| note        =\n}}\n\nGame three, the very first NHL game ever played after the official [[summer solstice]], shifted the series back to the Meadowlands in East Rutherford, New Jersey. During game one, the Detroit crowd taunted the Devils by collectively jeering \"Who cares?\" after each player was introduced. The Devils fans countered by raining boos down on the visiting Red Wings and delivering chants of \"Red Wings suck.\" The Devils did their talking on the ice, dominating the Red Wings, scoring five consecutive goals. [[Bruce Driver]], Claude Lemieux, [[Neal Broten]], [[Randy McKay]], and [[Bobby Holik]] all scored to give the Devils a 5–0 lead with 11:46 remaining in the game. Detroit scored twice on power-play goals by Sergei Fedorov and [[Steve Yzerman]] at 16:57 and 18:27 of the third period, but it was insufficient to keep New Jersey from winning a 5–2 game. They now had a commanding three-games-to-none lead in the series.\n\n===Game four===\n{{IceHockeybox\n| date        = June 24\n| time        =\n| team1       = Detroit Red Wings\n| team2       = '''New Jersey Devils'''\n| score       = 2 – 5\n| periods     =\n| reference   = http://bigmouthsports.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/1995-Stanley-Cup-Playoff-boxscores-NJ.pdf\n| goalie1     = [[Mike Vernon (ice hockey)|Mike Vernon]] 21 saves / 26 shots\n| goalie2     = [[Martin Brodeur]] 14 saves / 16 shots\n| progression =\n| goals1      = \n| goals2      =\n| official    = McCreary\n| linesman    =\n| linesman2   =\n| stadium     = [[Brendan Byrne Arena]]\n| attendance  =\n| penalties1  = \n| penalties2  = \n| shots1      =\n| shots2      =\n| note        =\n}}\n\nThe Devils jumped out to a 1–0 lead on Neal Broten's goal just 68 seconds into the game. However, the Red Wings were fighting to stay alive and tied the game on Sergei Fedorov's goal just 55 seconds later. Coffey scored a shorthanded goal at 13:01 to give Detroit a 2–1 lead. New Jersey responded less than five minutes later, at 17:45 on a slap-shot goal by Shawn Chambers that beat Mike Vernon glove-side. Then, in the second period, Scott Niedermayer passed to Broten, who chipped the puck over Vernon's glove from just in front of the net. The goal, Broten's second of the game, gave the Devils a 3–2 lead. New Jersey would increase its lead with goals by [[Sergei Brylin]] and Chambers (his second of the game) at 7:46 and 12:32 of the third period. The Devils won the game 5–2 and the series four games to none. It was New Jersey's first [[List of Stanley Cup champions|Stanley Cup Championship]] in team history. Devils [[goaltender]] [[Martin Brodeur]] allowed just seven goals against the Red Wings in the series and Devils forward Claude Lemieux was awarded the [[Conn Smythe Trophy]] as playoff MVP, having led all skaters in playoff goals with 13. He would win the Stanley Cup again the very next season with the Colorado Avalanche.\n\n==Broadcasting==\nIn the United States, this was the first year that Fox broadcast the Stanley Cup Finals.

Because the Devils swept the Red Wings and game four of the series was on Fox, their television play-by-play announcer, [[Mike Emrick]], called the win, alongside [[John Davidson (ice hockey)|John Davidson]], as they both were the lead broadcast team.

In retrospect, however, the 1995 Cup run started a mini-dynasty for the Devils, as they also won Stanley Cups in 2000 and 2003, under head coaches [[Larry Robinson]] and [[Pat Burns]] respectively. Martin Brodeur, Sergei Brylin, Ken Daneyko, Scott Niedermayer and Scott Stevens were the only players to play in every Devils' Stanley Cup title run.\n\nThe Red Wings won the [[Presidents' Trophy]] again the following season, thanks to a record-setting 62-win campaign. However, the Colorado Avalanche, who had moved from [[Quebec City]] as the [[Quebec Nordiques|Nordiques]], defeated them in six games of the [[1996 Stanley Cup playoffs|conference finals]]. This started a lengthy rivalry between the two teams, which culminated in a [[Red Wings–Avalanche brawl|brawl]] between the two teams at [[Joe Louis Arena]] in 1997. That brawl became the catalyst for Detroit's run to two consecutive Stanley Cups in 1997 and 1998, ending a 42-year title drought. The Red Wings later added two more Stanley Cups in 2002 and {{scfy|2008}}, hiking their total to 11.\n\nThe 1995 Cup Finals started a four-year period where every Cup Final was a sweep, which ended when the [[Dallas Stars]] needed six games to beat the [[Buffalo Sabres]] in {{scfy|1999}}.\n\n==See also==\n*[[1994–95 NHL season]]\n*[[1994–95 Detroit Red Wings season]]\n*[[1994–95 New Jersey Devils season]]\n*[[1995 Stanley Cup playoffs]]\n*[[List of Stanley Cup champions]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==References==\n*{{cite book|last=Diamond |first=Dan |title=Total Stanley Cup|year=2000|publisher=NHL}}\n*{{cite book |author=Podnieks, Andrew |author2=Hockey Hall of Fame |year=2004 |title=Lord Stanley's Cup |publisher=Triumph Books |isbn=978-1-55168-261-7}}\n\n{{s-start}}\n{{succession box |\n  before = [[1994 Stanley Cup Finals|New York Rangers<br>1994]] |\n  after = [[1996 Stanley Cup Finals|Colorado Avalanche<br>1996]] |\n  title = [[List of Stanley Cup champions|New Jersey Devils<br>Stanley Cup Champions]] |\n  years = 1995|\n}}\n{{s-end}}\n\n{{Navboxes|\nlist1=\n{{Stanley Cup Finals}}\n{{Detroit Red Wings}}\n{{New Jersey Devils}}\n{{NHL on Fox}}\n{{ESPN National Hockey Night}}\n{{Hockey Night in Canada}}\n{{NHL Radio}}\n}}\n\n[[Category:1995 Stanley Cup| ]]\n[[Category:1994–95 NHL season|Stanley Cup]]\n[[Category:Detroit Red Wings games]]\n[[Category:New Jersey Devils games]]\n[[Category:Stanley Cup Finals]]\n[[Category:Sports competitions in East Rutherford, New Jersey]]\n[[Category:20th century in East Rutherford, New Jersey]]\n[[Category:June 1995 sports events]]\n[[Category:1995 in sports in New Jersey]]\n[[Category:1995 in Detroit]]\n[[Category:Sports competitions in Detroit]]\n[[Category:1990 in sports in Michigan]]"

It was played at [[Cinergy Field]] in [[Cincinnati]], on October 4, 1999. The Mets won the game, 5–0, with [[starting pitcher]] [[Al Leiter]] pitching a two-hit [[Shutouts in baseball|shutout]]. As a result, the Mets qualified for the postseason and the Reds did not.\n\nThe game was necessary after both teams finished the season with identical [[Winning percentage|win–loss records]] of 96–66. Some described the Mets as collapsing late in the season while the race between the Reds and their division rival [[Houston Astros]] was close enough to create the possibility of a three-way tie. The Reds won a coin flip late in the season which, by rule at the time, awarded them [[home advantage|home field]] for the game. Upon winning, the Mets advanced to [[1999 National League Division Series|NL Division Series]] (NLDS) where they defeated the [[Arizona Diamondbacks]], three-games-to-one. They then advanced to the [[1999 National League Championship Series|NL Championship Series]] (NLCS) but were defeated by the [[Atlanta Braves]] in six games, bringing an end to the Mets' season. In [[baseball statistics]], the tie-breaker counted as the 163rd regular-season game by both teams, with all events in the game added to regular-season statistics.\n\n==Background==\n{{main article|1999 New York Mets season|1999 Cincinnati Reds season}}\nNeither the Mets nor the Reds had made the playoffs the previous season.

Linebacker [[Dont'a Hightower]] earned his first Pro Bowl selection and made the second All-Pro team, compiling 65 tackles and 2½ sacks. Linebacker [[Rob Ninkovich]] also made a big impact, recording 34 tackles, two forced fumbles, and four sacks.

Pro Bowl running back [[Devonta Freeman]] was the team's leading rusher, with 1,078 yards, 11 touchdowns, and 4.8 yards per rush. He was also a superb receiver out of the backfield, catching 54 passes for 462 yards and two more scores. Running back [[Tevin Coleman]] was also a major asset on the ground and through the air, with 520 rushing yards, 31 receptions for 421 yards, and 11 total touchdowns. The Falcons also had an excellent special teams unit led by veteran kick returner [[Eric Weems]]. His 24 punt returns for 273 yards gave him the sixth highest return average in the NFL (11.4), and he added another 391 yards returning kickoffs.

This policy is intended to help protect Canadian advertising revenue from being lost to viewers watching via U.S. feeds of a program. In 2016, as part of a larger series of regulatory reforms, the [[Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission]] (CRTC) banned the Super Bowl from being substituted under these circumstances, meaning that the telecast on [[CTV Television|CTV]]—a simulcast of the U.S. telecast with Canadian advertising inserted, would co-exist with feeds of the game from U.S. network affiliates. The CRTC cited dissatisfaction surrounding the practice from Canadian viewers—particularly the unavailability of the U.S. [[Super Bowl commercials|commercials]], which the CRTC cited as being an \"integral part\" of the game based on this reception, but also other technical problems caused by poorly implemented simsubs (such as reduced quality and missing content due to mistimed transitions back into the U.S. program feed).<ref name=gandm-bellappeal/><ref name=gandm-nomoresuperbowlsimsub>{{cite news|title=CRTC opens door for U.S. Super Bowl ads to air on Canadian TV|url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/report-on-business/industry-news/marketing/crtc-opens-door-for-us-super-bowl-ads-to-air-on-canadian-tv/article22696212/|newspaper=[[The Globe and Mail]]|date=January 29, 2015|accessdate=January 29, 2015}}</ref><ref name=crtc-2015-25>{{cite web|title=Broadcasting Regulatory Policy CRTC 2015-25|url=http://www.crtc.gc.ca/eng/archive/2015/2015-25.htm|publisher=Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission|accessdate=February 3, 2015}}</ref>\n\nThe NFL's Canadian rightsholder [[Bell Media]], as well as the league itself, have displayed objections to the policy; Bell felt that the decision devalued its exclusive Canadian rights to the game, and violated Canada's [[Broadcasting Act (1991)|Broadcasting Act]], which forbids the \"making of regulations singling out a particular program or licensee.\"<ref name=gandm-bellappeal>{{cite news|title=Bell appeals CRTC decision to air U.S. Super Bowl commercials|url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/report-on-business/bell-to-fight-crtc-ruling-on-super-bowl-simsub/article23244271/|accessdate=March 12, 2015|work=[[The Globe and Mail]]|location=Toronto|date=March 2, 2015}}</ref> On November 2, 2016, Bell was granted the right to challenge the ruling in the [[Federal Court of Appeal (Canada)|Federal Court of Appeal]].<ref name=\"gandm-bellwinappeal\">{{cite news|title=Bell wins right to appeal new Super Bowl ad policy|url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/report-on-business/bell-wins-right-to-appeal-new-super-bowl-ad-policy/article32643801/|website=The Globe and Mail|accessdate=November 2, 2016}}</ref> Bell, the NFL, and government representatives from both Canada and the U.S., have lobbied the CRTC for the rule to be retracted.<ref name=\"bloomberg-blitzes\">{{cite web|title=NFL Blitzes Trudeau in Arcane Super Bowl Advertising Dispute|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-01-09/nfl-blitzes-trudeau-in-arcane-super-bowl-advertising-dispute|website=Bloomberg|accessdate=January 18, 2017}}</ref> However, court action on the ruling was not taken in time for the game, meaning that it was in effect for the first time during Super Bowl LI.<ref name=\"gandm-cdnratings\">{{cite news|title=Bell’s Super Bowl ratings drop 39 per cent as CRTC ad policy takes effect|url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/report-on-business/bells-super-bowl-ratings-drop-39-per-cent-as-ad-policy-takes-effect/article33919635/|website=The Globe and Mail|accessdate=February 7, 2017}}</ref> Bell Media cited the decision, among other factors, as justification for a planned series of layoffs it announced on January 31, 2017.<ref name=\"fp-belllayoffs17\">{{cite web|last1=Jackson|first1=Emily|title=Bell Media cites CRTC Super Bowl ad policy as a factor in latest round of layoffs|url=http://business.financialpost.com/fp-tech-desk/bell-media-cites-crtc-super-bowl-ad-policy-in-latest-round-of-layoffs|website=Financial Post|accessdate=February 1, 2017}}</ref>\n\nThe simsub prohibition only applied to the game itself, and not pre-game or post-game programming (which was simulcast with Fox and subject to simsub).

It was the first time in his career that Brady had thrown a pick-six in his 33 postseason games,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nfl.com/videos/nfl-cant-miss-plays/0ap3000000783470/Can-t-Miss-Play-Brady-s-first-playoff-pick-six|title=Can't-Miss Play: Tom Brady's first-ever playoff pick six goes to Robert Alford|publisher=National Football League}}</ref> and Alford's 82 yard return was the second longest interception return in Super Bowl history.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nfl.com/superbowl/records/superbowls/player/ints|title=Super Bowl Records: Individual - Interceptions|publisher=National Football League}}</ref> Brady ultimately became the first quarterback to win a Super Bowl in which he threw a pick-six. Getting the ball back with 2:20 left in the second quarter, Brady completed a 15-yard pass to [[Martellus Bennett]], and then a short pass to running back [[James White (running back)|James White]], who took off for a 28-yard gain. The drive stalled at the Falcons 20-yard line, but [[Stephen Gostkowski]] kicked a field goal with two seconds left on the clock to send the teams into their locker rooms with the score 21–3.\n\n===Second half===\n\nNew England had an early third quarter scoring opportunity when Edelman returned a punt 26 yards to the Patriots' 47-yard line, but they could not gain a first down on the drive. Following the Patriots' punt, the Falcons started their drive on their own 15-yard line, Ryan completed two long passes to wide receiver Taylor Gabriel for gains of 17 and 35 yards to bring the ball to the New England 28-yard line. Four plays later, Ryan finished the 85-yard drive with a 6-yard touchdown pass to running back [[Tevin Coleman]], giving the Falcons a 28–3 lead with 8:31 left in the quarter. On the next series, Brady led the Patriots 75 yards in 13 plays for a responding touchdown, completing five of seven passes for 43 yards, the biggest a 17-yard completion to [[Danny Amendola]] on 4th-and-3 from the New England 46-yard line. Brady also made a big play with his legs, rushing for a 15-yard gain (which would be the longest rushing play by the Patriots on the day) on 3rd-and-8 from the Atlanta 35-yard line. Three subsequent carries by Blount moved the ball 15 yards to the 5-yard line, and then Brady threw the ball to White for a touchdown, making the score 28–9 after Gostkowski's extra point attempt hit the right goalpost.\n\nNew England then attempted an [[onside kick]], but the ball was recovered by Falcons linebacker [[LaRoy Reynolds]], and a penalty against Gostkowski for touching the ball before it went ten yards gave Atlanta even better field position. Ryan completed a 9-yard pass to Hooper to the Patriots 32-yard-line, but on the next play, a holding penalty on Atlanta offensive lineman [[Jake Matthews]] pushed the team back ten yards. Then after an incompletion, [[Trey Flowers]] and [[Kyle Van Noy]] shared a sack on Ryan that forced the Falcons to punt on the first play of the fourth quarter.\n\n[[Matt Bosher]]'s 42-yard punt pinned the Patriots back on their own 13-yard line. Brady led the next drive down the field, completing three passes to wide receiver [[Malcolm Mitchell]] for 40 yards and one to Bennett for 25 to bring the ball to the Falcons 7-yard line. However, Brady was sacked twice by defensive tackle [[Grady Jarrett]] over the next three plays, and the Patriots ended up having to settle for Gostkowski's 33-yard field goal that cut their deficit to two scores, 28–12, with less than 10 minutes left in the game. Atlanta had burned two of their three time outs on defense and equipment malfunction. On the third play of Atlanta's ensuing drive, linebacker [[Dont'a Hightower]] sacked Ryan as he was winding up for a pass, resulting in a fumble that was recovered by defensive tackle [[Alan Branch]] on the Falcons 25-yard line. New England soon cashed in their scoring opportunity, with Brady throwing a 6-yard touchdown pass to Amendola. Then White took a direct snap in for a two-point conversion to make the score 28–20 in favor of Atlanta with 5:56 left on the clock. The Patriots had run the same play for a two-point conversion with [[Kevin Faulk]] in their [[Super Bowl XXXVIII]] victory.\n\nOn the first play of Atlanta's next possession, Freeman caught a short pass from Ryan and ran it for a 39-yard gain, the longest play of the game for either team. Then on 2nd-and-9 from the Patriots 49-yard line, Ryan threw a deep pass to Jones at the right sideline, who made an acrobatic sideline catch for a 27-yard gain, giving the Falcons a first down on the Patriots 22-yard line with 4:40 left on the clock and a chance for a late-game two-score lead.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.nfl.com/videos/nfl-cant-miss-plays/0ap3000000783649/Can-t-Miss-Play-Julio-makes-insane-sideline-catch|title=Can't-Miss Play: Julio Jones makes insane sideline catch in Super Bowl LI|website=NFL.com|language=en|access-date=2017-04-10}}</ref> On the next play, Freeman ran for a 1-yard loss on a tackle by [[Devin McCourty]]. Atlanta tried to pass the ball on second down, but Flowers sacked Ryan for a 12-yard loss on the Patriots 35-yard line. Ryan then completed a 9-yard pass to [[Mohamed Sanu]] on 3rd-and 23, but this was negated by a holding penalty on Matthews. Now out of field goal range and faced with 3rd-and-33 from the New England 45-yard line, Ryan threw an incomplete pass, and the team was left with no choice but to punt the ball to New England.\n\nBosher's 36-yard kick gave the Patriots the ball on their own 9-yard line with 3:30 left on the clock and two of their timeouts left. After two incompletions, Brady picked up a first down with a 16-yard pass to [[Chris Hogan (American football)|Chris Hogan]]. After an 11-yard pass to Mitchell, Brady threw a pass that was nearly intercepted by Alford. Instead, he batted the ball in the air, and it fell into the arms of Edelman, who made a diving catch and just barely managed to get his hands under the ball before it hit the ground, picking up 23 yards. Atlanta challenged the catch, but the referees confirmed the call on the field and Atlanta lost their final time out. Brady's next pass to Amendola gained 20 yards to the Falcons 21-yard line as the clock ran down below the two-minute warning. Two more passes to White gained 20 yards and gave New England a first down at the 1-yard line. With one minute left, White scored on a 1-yard touchdown run, and Brady completed a 2-point conversion pass to Amendola, tying the score at 28. Atlanta started their drive deep in their own end with zero time outs. The Falcons failed to get in range to score a possible game-winning field goal and punted, with the Patriots fair catching the ball at their own 35-yard line. The Patriots considered, but ultimately declined, ending regulation on what would have been the first [[fair catch kick]] ever attempted in a Super Bowl.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.boston.com/sports/new-england-patriots/2017/02/06/bill-belichick-passed-up-an-opportunity-to-end-super-bowl-51-in-the-weirdest-possible-way|title=Bill Belichick passed up an opportunity to end Super Bowl 51 in the weirdest possible way|first=Nick|last=DeCosta-Klipa|work=The Boston Globe|date=February 7, 2017|accessdate=February 7, 2017}}</ref> Instead, New England attempted a fake [[quarterback kneel]] running play for [[Dion Lewis]]. The play gained several yards but failed to score and sent the Super Bowl into overtime for the first time in the game's history. Super Bowl LI became the first [[History of the National Football League championship|NFL championship game]] to go into an overtime period since the historic [[1958 NFL Championship Game]] between the [[1958 Baltimore Colts season|Baltimore Colts]] and the [[1958 New York Giants season|New York Giants]].<ref>{{cite book|last1=Bowden|first1=Mark|title=The Best Game Ever: Giants vs. Colts, 1958, and the Birth of the Modern NFL|date=2008|publisher=Atlantic Monthly Press|isbn=978-0-87113-988-7}}</ref>\n\n===Overtime===\nThe Patriots won the coin toss to start overtime, and elected to receive the ball. Starting at their 25-yard line after a touchback, Brady completed passes to White, Amendola, and Hogan for gains of 6, 14, and 18 yards, respectively. Then after White was dropped for a 3-yard loss, Brady completed a 15-yard pass to Edelman to the Falcons 25-yard line. White then took a lateral throw from Brady to the 15-yard line.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/sport/american-football/38876834|title=Super Bowl LI: New England Patriots recover from record deficit to beat Atlanta Falcons|date=6 February 2017|publisher=BBC Sport|accessdate=7 February 2017}}</ref> Brady's pass to Bennett in the end zone fell incomplete, but Falcons linebacker [[De'Vondre Campbell]] was called for [[pass interference]], giving the Patriots first-and-goal from the Falcons' 2-yard line.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2017/feb/05/new-england-patriots-super-bowl-51-champions-atlanta-falcons|title=Super Bowl 2017: Tom Brady leads Patriots to historic comeback win|date=6 February 2017|work=Guardian|accessdate=7 February 2017}}</ref> On first down, Brady threw another incomplete pass to Bennett that was deflected by [[Vic Beasley]].

The [[AFL–NFL merger]] agreement of June 1966 called for a \"world championship game\" between the league champions. When a date of January 15, 1967, was established, the AFL title game was moved to January 1, same as the [[1966 NFL Championship Game|NFL championship game]] in [[Cotton Bowl (stadium)|Dallas]].\n\nLike the NFL, the host team for the title game was alternated between the divisions, with the Eastern hosting in even-numbered years and the Western in odd.

[[Mike Garrett]] was the team's leading rusher, gaining 801 yards and 6 touchdowns. Other reliable options included [[Curtis McClinton]] (540 yards, 4 touchdowns) and [[Bert Coan]] (521 yards, 7 touchdowns).

This led to the first score of the game, a 29-yard touchdown pass from [[Len Dawson]] to tight end  [[Fred Arbanas]] .  After an exchange of punts, Buffalo tied the game when receiver [[Elbert Dubenion]] raced ahead of defensive back [[Fred Williamson]] \"the Hammer\", caught a pass from [[Jack Kemp]] at the Chiefs 45, and raced all the way to the end zone for a 69-yard touchdown reception.\n\nLater on, [[Mike Garrett]]'s 27-yard punt return gave the Chiefs a first down on the Bills 45-yard line.  After a few plays, Dawson made a key 15-yard completion to Arbanas advancing to the Buffalo 29.  It was the last catch of the day for Arbanas, who ended up leaving the game with a separated shoulder; however, it paid off big time as Dawson threw a 29-yard touchdown pass to [[Otis Taylor (American football)|Otis Taylor]] on the next play, giving the Chiefs a 14–7 second quarter lead. Buffalo responded with a drive deep into Chiefs territory, featuring Kemp's 30-yard completion to rookie receiver [[Rob Burnett (wide receiver)|Rob Burnett]] to the Kansas City 12-yard line.  But in what turned out to be one of the most crucial plays of the game, Kemp's next pass resulted in a costly interception in the end zone by safety [[Johnny Robinson (safety)|Johnny Robinson]], who returned the football 72 yards to the Bills 28.  [[Mike Mercer (American football)|Mike Mercer]] eventually cashed in the turnover with a 32-yard field goal that gave the Chiefs a 17–7 halftime lead.<ref name=miwendrn/>\n\nThe third quarter was a defensive struggle with each team punting the football twice.  Near the end, Kansas City got possession of the football on the Bills 42-yard line, but failed to score when Mercer missed a 49-yard field goal attempt.\n\nThe Chiefs put the game away with consecutive touchdown drives in the fourth quarter.  First, Dawson's 45-yard completion to [[Chris Burford]] gave the team a first down at the Buffalo 4-yard line.  Garrett then ran the ball on the next four plays, concluding with a 1-yard touchdown run.  On the first play of Buffalo's next drive, receiver [[Glenn Bass]] lost a fumble that [[Bobby Hunt]] returned 21 yards to the Bills 20-yard line, which led  to another Garrett touchdown run, the final score of the game from 18 yards.<ref name=miwendrn/> Buffalo could do nothing with their next drive, and on their final one of the day, Kemp was intercepted by [[Emmitt Thomas]].<ref>http://media.kcchiefs.com/media/143725/playoff_history_and_summaries.pdf{{dead link|date=June 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref><ref>http://archives.chicagotribune.com/1967/01/02/page/97/article/chiefs-rout-buffalo-31-to-7</ref>\n\nDawson completed 16 of 24 passes for 227 yards and two touchdowns and ran for 28 yards.  Garrett rushed for 39 yards and two touchdowns, caught 4 passes for 16 yards, returned a kickoff for 3 yards, and added another 37 yards on 3 punt returns.  Kemp completed 12 of 25 passes for 253 yards and a touchdown, coupled with two costly interceptions.

On third down from the one, [[Dan Towler|\"Deacon\" Dan Towler]] ran the ball in for a touchdown to give the Rams a 14–10 lead.\n\nEarly in the fourth quarter, the Rams increased their lead with a 17-yard field goal by [[Bob Waterfield]]. The Browns answered back with an 8-play, 70-yard drive that ended with a 5-yard touchdown run by [[Ken Carpenter (football player)|Ken Carpenter]] to tie the game at 17–17. Twenty-five seconds later late in the fourth quarter, [[Tom Fears]] beat defenders [[Cliff Lewis (quarterback)|Cliff Lewis]] and [[Tommy James (football player)|Tommy James]] and received a [[Norm Van Brocklin]] pass at midfield and raced to the end zone for a 73-yard touchdown.

Held annually, [[The Boat Race]] is a [[Rowing (sport)#Side by side|side-by-side rowing]] race between crews from the Universities of [[University of Oxford|Oxford]] and [[University of Cambridge|Cambridge]] along the [[River Thames]] in London. Despite Cambridge having the heavier crew, Oxford were pre-race favourites having had a successful preparation period, including a victory over [[Leander Club|Leander]].  Cambridge won the toss and chose to start on the Surrey side of the river. Partway through, with the boats level, the race was temporarily halted to avoid injury to protester Trenton Oldfield, who swam in front of the two crews.  After the race was restarted, one of the Oxford crew suffered irreparable damage to his [[Blade (rowing)|blade]] following a clash of oars with the Cambridge boat, ending Oxford's chances of victory.  The race was eventually won by Cambridge by four-and-a-quarter lengths, in a consolidated time of 17 minutes 23 seconds.\n\nImmediately after completing the race, a member of the Oxford crew collapsed, but later recovered.  Oldfield was later jailed for six months for causing a public nuisance, and as a result of the disruption, security for subsequent Boat Races was increased.   The reserve race was won by Oxford's Isis in a record time, while the [[Women's Boat Race]] was won by Cambridge.\n\n==Background==\n[[The Boat Race]] is a [[Rowing (sport)#Side by side|side-by-side rowing]] competition between the [[University of Oxford]] (sometimes referred to as the \"Dark Blues\")<ref name=blues>{{Cite web | url = https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2003/apr/06/theobserver | work = [[The Observer]] | title = Dark Blues aim to punch above their weight | date = 6 April 2003 | accessdate = 8 April 2014 }}</ref> and the [[University of Cambridge]] (sometimes referred to as the \"Light Blues\").<ref name=blues/>  The race was first held in 1829, and since 1845 has taken place on the {{convert|4.2|mi|km|adj=on}} [[The Championship Course|Championship Course]] on the [[River Thames]] in southwest London.<ref>{{Cite web | url = http://www.telegraph.co.uk/travel/destinations/europe/uk/london/10719622/University-Boat-Race-2014-spectators-guide.html | work = [[The Daily Telegraph]] | accessdate = 3 June 2014 | date = 25 March 2014 |title = University Boat Race 2014: spectators' guide | first = Oliver |last =Smith}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web | url = http://theboatraces.org/the-course | title = The Course| accessdate = 24 July 2014 | publisher = The Boat Race Company Ltd}}</ref>  The rivalry is a major point of honour between the two universities, followed throughout the United Kingdom and broadcast worldwide.<ref name=CBC>{{cite news|title=Former Winnipegger in winning Oxford-Cambridge Boat Race crew|date=6 April 2014|publisher=[[CBC News]]|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/manitoba/former-winnipegger-in-winning-oxford-cambridge-boat-race-crew-1.2600176|accessdate=7 April 2014}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web | url = http://theboatrace.org/men/tv-and-radio| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141006123036/http://theboatrace.org/men/tv-and-radio | archivedate= 6 October 2014 | title = TV and radio | publisher = The Boat Race Company Limited | accessdate = 7 July 2014}}</ref>  Oxford went into the 2012 race as reigning champions, having beaten Cambridge by four lengths in the [[The Boat Race 2011|previous year's race]].

It was held on February 19, 2006 at [[Daytona International Speedway]] in [[Daytona Beach, Florida]]. [[Jimmie Johnson]] won the race in a [[green-white-checker finish]]. It was the second Daytona 500 in a row to go longer than 200 laps and {{convert|500|miles|km}}; this race, like the [[2005 Daytona 500|previous Daytona 500]], had a total distance of 203 laps and {{convert|507.5|miles|km}}.

There were several lead changes in the early part of the race, with a total of 32.<ref name=\"Results\"/><ref name=\"Race Results and Statistics\">{{cite web|url=http://www.cbssports.com/nascar/racecenter/CUP/2006/001|title=NASCAR 2006 Daytona 500 Race Results|website=CBSSports.com|accessdate=2015-11-29}}</ref> The first caution came on lap&nbsp;18 when [[Martin Truex, Jr.]] hit the wall. During this caution, Burton was passed by [[Elliott Sadler]] for the lead a lap later. The race restarted on lap 20 and four laps later, [[Jeff Gordon]] took the led away from Sadler. [[Carl Edwards]], a popular \"dark horse candidate\" for the [[Sprint Cup Series|Nextel Cup]] championship, had his day end early, as he was involved in a five-car pileup on lap 80 that collected [[Dale Jarrett]], [[Kyle Petty]], [[Jeff Green (racing driver)|Jeff Green]], [[J.J. Yeley]], and [[Joe Nemechek]]. This was the biggest crash of the day, since the \"Big One\" never occurred. This would also bring out the third caution flag. Because of this, Edwards finished 43rd. [[Tony Stewart]] was a \"magnet for controversy\", tangling in two incidents with [[Jeff Gordon]] on lap 48 and [[Matt Kenseth]] on lap 106. The first incident, which left debris on the track,<ref name=\"Results\"/> brought out the second caution and the second brought out the fifth caution. Stewart was penalized for aggressive driving after the incident with Kenseth, in which he blocked the No.&nbsp;17 car into the grass, causing it to spin and hit the turn 3 wall. Kenseth took matters into his own hands and was [[Racing flag#The black flag|black-flagged]] for hitting Stewart's car in retaliation on pit road. The three drivers involved in these two incidents repaired their cars and got back into contention.\n\n[[Jimmie Johnson]] had one of the strongest cars all day. He took the lead with 10 laps to go just as the ninth caution flag came out for an crash involving Gordon, [[Kurt Busch]], [[Jamie McMurray]], and [[Sterling Marlin]]. This set up a 10-lap battle for the win. The race was extended into \"overtime\" when McMurray and Burton collided on lap 197, bringing out yet the 10th caution. The [[green-white-checker finish]] ended when [[Casey Mears]] and [[Ryan Newman (racing driver)|Ryan Newman]] battled for second, leaving Johnson to take the victory. The race ended under caution when [[Greg Biffle]] crashed in turn 4, just before Johnson crossed the start-finish line. The 48th running of the Daytona 500 was the first win for the #48 car on a [[restrictor plate]] track. This was also Johnson's 19th career win and his first during his streak of five consecutive NASCAR Sprint Cup Championships from [[2006 NASCAR Nextel Cup Series|2006]] to [[2010 NASCAR Sprint Cup Series|2010]].\n\nOne surprise of this race was [[Kirk Shelmerdine]], who finished 20th. He had barely qualified for the Daytona 500 and his independently-owned No.&nbsp;27 was fielded with a car that had a borrowed engine and donated tires, as well as a team with a volunteer pit crew.\n\n==Results==\n{| class=\"sortable wikitable\" style=\"font-size:95%\"\n|-\n!

It featured American singer [[Katy Perry]], with singer [[Lenny Kravitz]] and rapper [[Missy Elliott]] as special guests. The halftime show was critically acclaimed and its broadcast on [[NBC Sunday Night Football|NBC]] attracted 118.5 million viewers in the United States and 120.7 million worldwide, receiving the largest ratings in the history of the Super Bowl and becoming the most watched of all-time.
