In April 1904, he married Charlotte Hellmich. The couple had five children.\n\n==Military career==\n{{moresources|section|date=January 2018}}\nAfter graduating in 1907, Blomberg entered the [[German General Staff|General Staff]] in 1908. Serving with distinction on the [[Western Front (World War I)|Western Front]] during the [[World War I|First World War]], Blomberg was awarded the ''[[Pour le Mérite]]''.{{cn|date=January 2018}}\n\nIn 1920, Blomberg was appointed chief of staff of the Döberitz Brigade, and in 1921 was made chief of staff of the [[Stuttgart]] Army Area. In 1925, Blomberg was made chief of army training by General [[Hans von Seeckt]]. By 1927, Blomberg was a [[major-general]] and chief of the [[Truppenamt|Troop Office]] ({{lang-de|Truppenamt}}), which was the thinly disguised [[German General Staff]] forbidden by the Treaty of Versailles.<ref name=\"Paehler 2009\">{{cite web|last=Paehler|first=Katrin|title=General ohne Eigenschaften?|publisher=H-Net Online|date=June 2009|url=http://www.h-net.org/reviews/showrev.php?id=24691|accessdate=2013-05-05}}</ref> \n\nIn 1928, Blomberg visited the [[Soviet Union]], where he was much impressed by the high status of the [[Red Army]], and left as a convinced believer in the value of totalitarian [[dictatorship]] as the prerequisite for military power.<ref>{{cite book|last=Wheeler-Bennett|first=John|year=1967|title=The Nemesis of Power: The German Army in Politics 1918–1945|location=London, UK|publisher=Macmillan|pp=295–96|ref=harv}}</ref> \n\nThis was part of a broader shift on the part of the German military to the idea of a [[totalitarian]] ''Wehrstaat'' (Defence State) which, starting in the mid-1920s, had become popular with officers. The German historian [[Eberhard Kolb]] wrote that:{{bquote|...from the mid-1920s onwards the Army leaders had developed and propagated new social conceptions of a militarist kind, tending towards a fusion of the military and civilian sectors and ultimately a totalitarian military state (''Wehrstaat'').<ref>Kolb, Eberhard ''The Weimar Republic'' London: Routledge, 2005, p. 173</ref>}}\n\nBlomberg's visit to the Soviet Union in 1928 had the effect of confirming his views about totalitarian powers being the greatest military powers. Blomberg believed the next world war, like the previous one, would become a [[total war]], requiring the full mobilisation of German society and economy by the state, and that a totalitarian state would be most apt for effectively preparing society militarily and economically for war in peacetime.<ref name=\"Paehler 2009\"/> Like the rest of Nazi Germany's military elite, Blomberg took it for granted that for Germany to achieve the \"world power status\" that it had sought (but failed to obtain) in the First World War would require another war, and that such a war would be a total war of a highly mechanised, industrial type.{{sfn|Müller|1987|p=26}}\n\nAfter arguing with General [[Kurt von Schleicher]] in 1929, however, Blomberg was removed from his post and made military commander of [[East Prussia]]. In 1929, Schleicher came into conflict with Blomberg at the ''[[Truppenamt]]''. In early 1929, Schleicher had started a policy of \"frontier defense\" (''Grenzschutz'') under which the ''[[Reichswehr]]'' would stockpile arms in secret depots and start training volunteers in excess of the limits imposed by Versailles in the eastern parts of Germany facing Poland; in order to avoid incidents with France, there was to be no policy of ''Grenzschutz'' in the western parts of Germany.<ref>{{cite book|last=Patch|first=William L.|year=2006|title=Heinrich Bruning and the Dissolution of the Weimar Republic|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-052102541-6|ref=harv}}, p. 50.</ref> \n\nThe French planned to withdraw from the Rhineland in June 1930 — five years earlier than what the Treaty of Versailles had called for  — and Schleicher wanted no violations of Versailles that might seem to threaten France before the French left the Rhineland. When Blomberg, whom Schleicher personally disliked, insisted on extending ''Grenzschutz'' to border areas with France, in August 1929 Schleicher leaked the news to the press that Blomberg had attended armed maneuvers by volunteers in [[Westphalia]].{{sfn|Patch|2006|p=51}} [[List of German defence ministers|Defence Minister]] General [[Wilhelm Groener]], called Blomberg to Berlin to explain himself. Blomberg expected Schleicher to stick to the traditional ''Reichswehr'' policy of denying everything, and was shocked to see Schleicher instead attack him in front of Groener as a man who had recklessly exposed Germany to the risk of providing the French with an excuse to stay on in the Rhineland until 1935.{{sfn|Patch|2006|p=51}} \n\nAs a result, Blomberg was demoted from command of the ''Truppenamt'' and sent to command a division in East Prussia.{{sfn|Patch|2006|p=51}} Blomberg would later emerge as Schleicher's most powerful enemy within the ''Reichswehr''.{{cn|date=January 2018}} Since [[East Prussia]] was cut off from the rest of Germany and had only one infantry division stationed there, Blomberg - to increase the number of fighting men in the event of a war with Poland - started to make lists of all the men fit for military service, which further increased the attraction of a totalitarian state able to mobilise an entire society for war to him, and of an ideologically motivated ''[[levée en masse]]'' as the best way to fight the next war.<ref name=\"Paehler 2009\"/> During his time as commander of [[Wehrkreis]] I, the military district which comprised East Prussia, Blomberg fell under the influence of a [[Nazi Party|Nazi]]-sympathising Lutheran chaplain, [[Ludwig Müller (theologian)| Ludwig Müller]], who introduced Blomberg to [[National Socialism]].{{sfn|Wheeler-Bennett|1967|p=296}} Blomberg cared little for Nazi doctrines ''per se'', his support for the Nazis being motivated by his belief that only a dictatorship could make Germany a great military power again, and that the Nazis were the best party to establish a dictatorship in Germany.{{sfn|Wheeler-Bennett|1967|pp=296-97}}\n\nBecause he had the command of only one infantry division in East Prussia, Blomberg depended very strongly on ''Grenzschutz'' to increase the number of fighting men available. This led him to co-operate closely with the [[Sturmabteilung|SA]] as a source of volunteers for ''Grenzschutz'' forces.<ref name=\"Feuchtwanger, Edgar pages 252–253\">Feuchtwanger, Edgar ''From Weimar to Hitler'', London: Macmillan, 1993, pp. 252–53.</ref> Blomberg's had excellent relations with the SA at this time, which led to the SA serving by 1931 as an unofficial militia backing up the ''Reichswehr''. Many generals saw East Prussia as an model for future Army-Nazi co-operation all over Germany.<ref name=\"Feuchtwanger, Edgar pages 252–253\"/> \n\nBlomberg's interactions with the SA in East Prussia led him to the conclusion that Nazis made for excellent soldiers, which further increased the appeal of National Socialism for him.<ref name=\"Feuchtwanger, Edgar pages 252–253\"/> But at the same time, Blomberg saw the SA only as a junior partner to the [[Reichsheer | Army]], and utterly opposed the SA's ambitions to replace the ''Reichswehr'' as Germany's main military force. Blomberg, like almost all German generals, envisioned a future Nazi-Army relationship where the Nazis would indoctrinate ordinary people with the right sort of ultra-nationalist, militarist values so that when young German men joined the ''Reichswehr'' they would be already half-converted into soldiers while at the same time making it clear that control of military matters would rest solely with the generals. In 1931, he visited the USA, where he openly proclaimed his belief in the certainty and the benefits of a Nazi government for Germany.{{sfn|Wheeler-Bennett|1967|p=297}} Blomberg's first wife Charlotte died on 11 May 1932, leaving him with two sons and three daughters.<ref>{{Cite book |author1= Barnett, Correlli|author2=Barnett, Corelli|title=Hitler's Generals|year=1989|publisher=Grove Press|isbn=0-8021-3994-9|page=131}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book|last=Schäfer|first=Kirstin A.|title=Werner von Blomberg: Hitlers erster Feldmarschall: eine Biographie|year=2006|publisher=Schöningh|language=de|isbn=3-506-71391-4|ref=harv}} P. 22.</ref>\n\nIn 1932, Blomberg served as part of the German delegation to the [[World Disarmament Conference]] in [[Geneva]] where, during his time as the German chief military delegate, he not only continued his pro-Nazi remarks to the press, but used his status as Germany's chief military delegate to communicate his views to [[Paul von Hindenburg]], whose position as [[Reichspräsident|President of Germany]] made him German Supreme Commander in Chief.{{sfn|Wheeler-Bennett|1967|p=297}} \n\nIn his reports to Hindenburg, Blomberg wrote that his arch-rival Schleicher's attempts to create the ''Wehrstaat'' had clearly failed, and that Germany needed a new approach to forming the ''Wehrstaat''.{{sfn|Müller|1987|p=28}} By late January 1933 it was clear that the Schleicher government could only stay in power by proclaiming [[martial law]] and by authorizing the ''Reichswehr'' to crush popular opposition. In doing so, the military would have to kill hundreds, if not thousands of German civilians; any régime established in this way could never expect to build the national consensus necessary to create the ''Wehrstaat''.<ref name=\"Geyer 1983, pp. 122\">Geyer, Michael \"Etudes in Political History: Reichswehr, NSDAP and the Seizure of Power\" pp. 101–23, from ''The Nazi Machtergreifung'', edited by Peter Stachura, London: Allen & Unwin, 1983, pp. 122–23.</ref> The military had decided that Hitler alone was capable of peacefully creating the national consensus that would allow the creation of the ''Wehrstaat'', and thus the military successfully brought pressure on Hindenburg to appoint Hitler as [[Reichskanzler|Chancellor]].<ref name=\"Geyer 1983, pp. 122\"/> Blomberg served as one of the main channels by which the ''Reichswehr'' informed Hindenburg of their wish to see Hitler become Chancellor.{{cn|date=January 2018}}\n\nIn late January 1933 President Hindenburg - without informing the chancellor, Schleicher, or the army commander, General [[Kurt von Hammerstein]] - recalled Blomberg from the World Disarmament Conference to return to Berlin.{{sfn|Wheeler-Bennett|1967|p=282}} Upon learning of this, Schleicher guessed correctly that the order to recall Blomberg to Berlin meant his own government was doomed.{{sfn|Wheeler-Bennett|1967|p=282}} When Blomberg arrived at the railroad station in Berlin on 28 January 1933, he was met by [[Adolf-Friedrich Kuntzen|Major von Kuntzen]] and by Major [[Oskar von Hindenburg]], adjutant and son of President Hindenburg. Kuntzen had orders from Hammerstein for Blomberg to report at once to the Defence Ministry, while Oskar von Hindenburg had orders for Blomberg to report directly to the {{ill|Reichspräsidentenpalais|de}} (presidential palace).{{sfn|Wheeler-Bennett|1967|p=284}} \n\nOver and despite Kuntzen's protests, Blomberg chose to go with Hindenburg to meet the president, who swore him in as defence minister.{{sfn|Wheeler-Bennett|1967|p=284}} This was done in a manner contrary to the Weimar constitution, under which the president could only swear in a minister after receiving the advice of the chancellor. Hindenburg had not consulted Schleicher about his wish to see Blomberg replace him as defence minister) because in late January 1933, there were wild (and untrue) rumours circulating in Berlin that Schleicher was planning to stage a ''[[putsch]]''.<ref name=Kershaw1998_422>{{cite book|last=Kershaw|first=Ian|year=1998|title=Hitler Hubris|location= New York City|publisher= Norton|ref=harv}}, pg. 422.</ref> To counter alleged plans of a ''[[putsch]]'' by Schleicher, Hindenburg wanted to remove Schleicher as defence minister as soon as possible.{{r|Kershaw1998_422}} \n\nTwo days later, on 30 January 1933, Hindenburg swore in [[Adolf Hitler]] as Chancellor, after telling him that Blomberg was to be his defence minister regardless of his wishes. Hitler for his part welcomed and accepted Blomberg. Hitler told Blomberg, much to his satisfaction, that he wanted the Army to continue to be the main military force of the ''Reich''.{{cn|date=January 2018}}\n\n===Minister of Defence===\nIn 1933, Blomberg rose to national prominence when he was appointed Minister of Defence in Hitler's government. Blomberg became one of Hitler's most devoted followers, working feverishly to expand the size and power of the army. Blomberg was made a [[colonel general]] for his services in 1933. Although Blomberg and his predecessor [[Kurt von Schleicher|Schleicher]] loathed one another, their feud was purely personal, not political, and in all essentials Blomberg and Schleicher had identical views on foreign and defence policies. Their dispute was simply over who was best qualified to carry out these policies, not over policy differences.{{sfn|Müller|1987|p=30}}\n\nBlomberg was chosen personally by President Hindenburg as a man he trusted to safeguard the interests of the Defence Ministry, and as a man who could be expected to work well with Hitler.{{sfn|Müller|1987|p=30}} Above all, Hindenburg saw Blomberg as a man who would safeguard the German military's traditional \"state within the state\" status dating back to Prussian times, under which the military did not take orders from the civilian government headed by the chancellor, but rather co-existed as an equal alongside the civilian government, owing its allegiance only to the head of state (not the chancellor, who was the head of the government).{{sfn|Müller|1987|p=30}} \n\nUntil 1918, the head of state had been the Emperor, and since 1925 had been President Hindenburg himself.{{sfn|Müller|1987|p=30}} Defending the military \"state within the state\" while trying to reconcile the military to the Nazi system was to be one of Blomberg's major concerns as a defence minister.{{sfn|Müller|1987|p=30}}\n\nBlomberg's first act as defence minister was to carry out a purge of the officers associated with his hated arch-enemy Schleicher.{{sfn|Wheeler-Bennett|1967|p=297}} Blomberg sacked [[Ferdinand von Bredow]] as chief of the ''Ministeramt'' and replaced him with General [[Walter von Reichenau]], [[Eugen Ott (ambassador)|Eugen Ott]] was dismissed as chief of the ''Wehramt'' and sent to [[Japan]] as [[military attaché]], and General [[Wilhelm Adam (general)|Wilhelm Adam]] was sacked as chief of the ''[[Truppenamt]]'' (the disguised General Staff) and replaced with [[Ludwig Beck]].{{sfn|Wheeler-Bennett|1967|pp=298-99}} \n\nBritish historian [[John Wheeler-Bennett|Sir John Wheeler-Bennett]] wrote about the \"ruthless\" way that Blomberg set about isolating and undermining the power of the army commander-in-chief, a close associate of Schleicher's, General [[Kurt von Hammerstein-Equord]], to the point that in February 1934 Hammerstein finally resigned in despair, as his powers had become more nominal than real.{{sfn|Wheeler-Bennett|1967|p=300}} With Hammerstein's resignation, the entire Schleicher faction which had dominated the army since 1926 had all been removed from their positions within the High Command. Wheeler-Bennett commented that as a military politician Blomberg was every bit as ruthless as Schleicher had been.{{sfn|Wheeler-Bennett|1967|p=300}}\n\nFar more serious than dealing with the followers of Schleicher was Blomberg's relations with the SA. Blomberg was an ardent supporter of the National Socialist dictatorship, but he was resolutely opposed to any effort to subject the military to the control of the Nazi Party or that of any of its affiliated organisations such as the SA or the SS, and throughout his time as a minister he fought fiercely to protect the institutional autonomy of the military.{{sfn|Wheeler-Bennett|1967|pp=308-09}} \n\nBy the autumn of 1933, Blomberg had come into conflict with [[Ernst Röhm]] who made it clear that he wanted to see the SA absorb the ''Reichswehr'', a prospect that Blomberg was determined to prevent at all costs. In December 1933, he made clear to Hitler his displeasure about Röhm being appointed to the Cabinet.{{sfn|Wheeler-Bennett|1967|pp=308-09}} \n\nIn February 1934, when Röhm penned a memo about the SA absorbing the ''Reichswehr'' to become the new military force, Blomberg informed Hitler the Army would never accept this under any conditions. Beginning March 1934, Blomberg and Röhm openly fought each other at cabinet meetings, exchanging insults and threats.{{sfn|Wheeler-Bennett|1967|pp=301-11}} As a result of his increasingly heated feud with Röhm, Blomberg warned Hitler that he must curb the ambitions of the SA, or the Army would do that job themselves.{{sfn|Wheeler-Bennett|1967|p=312}}\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 183-1988-0106-501, von Blomberg. 40-jähriges Militärjubiläum.jpg|thumb|260px|War minister and OKW commander Werner von Blomberg followed by the three armed forces chiefs inspects a parade in honor of his 1937 birthday.|alt=Werner von Blomberg inspects a parade in his honor on his birthday. Soldiers with Guns stand to attention.]]\nTo defend the military \"state within the state\", Blomberg followed a strategy of Nazifying the military more and more in a paradoxical effort to persuade Hitler that it was not necessary to end the traditional \"state within the state\", to prevent ''[[Gleichschaltung]]'' being imposed by engaging in what can be called a process of \"self-Gleichschaltung\".<ref>Bartov, Omer, \"Soldiers, Nazis and War in the Third Reich\", pp. 129–150 from ''The Third Reich: The Essential Readings'' edited by Christian Leitz, London: Blackwell, 1999, p. 143.</ref> \n\nIn February 1934, Blomberg, on his own initiative, had all of the men considered to be Jews serving in the ''Reichswehr'' given an automatic and immediate [[dishonorable discharge]].<ref name=\"Förster1998_268\">{{cite book|last=Förster|first=Jürgen|authorlink=Jürgen Förster|chapter=Complicity or Entanglement?

As a result, seven officers, eight officer cadets, thirteen NCOs and 28 privates from the Army, and three officers, four officer candidates, three NCOs and four sailors from the Navy were dishonourably discharged, together with four civilian employees of the Defence Ministry.{{sfn|Wette|2006|pp=71-72}} \n\nWith the exception of [[Erich von Manstein]], who complained that Blomberg had ruined the careers of some seventy men for something that was not their fault, there were no objections.{{sfn|Wette|2006|p=73}} Again, on his own initiative as part of \"self-Gleichschaltung\", Blomberg had the ''Reichswehr'' in May 1934 adopt Nazi symbols into their uniforms.{{sfn|Wheeler-Bennett|1967|p=312}} In 1935, Blomberg worked hard to ensure that the Wehrmacht complied with the [[Nuremberg Laws]] by preventing so-called ''[[Mischling]]s'' from serving.{{sfn|Förster|1998|pp=268-69}}\n\nBlomberg had a reputation as something of a lackey to Hitler. As such, he was nicknamed \"Rubber Lion\" by some of his critics in the army who were less than enthusiastic about Hitler. One of the few notable exceptions was during the run-up to the [[Night of the Long Knives]], June 30–July 2, 1934.{{cn|date=January 2018}} In early June, Hindenburg decided that unless Hitler did something to end the growing political tension in Germany, he would declare martial law and turn over control of the government to the army. Blomberg, who had been known to oppose the growing power of the [[Sturmabteilung|SA]], was chosen to inform Hitler of this decision on the president's behalf.{{cn|date=January 2018}}\n\nIn the same year, after Hindenburg's death on August 2, as part of his \"self-Gleichschaltung\" strategy, Blomberg personally ordered all soldiers in the army and all sailors in the Navy to pledge the ''[[Reichswehreid]]'' (oath of allegiance) not to ''People and Fatherland'', but to the new ''Führer'' Adolf Hitler, which is thought to have limited later opposition to Hitler. The oath was the initiative of Blomberg and that of the ''Ministeramt'' chief General [[Walther von Reichenau]], the entire military took an [[Hitler oath|oath of personal loyalty]] to Hitler, who was most surprised at the offer; the popular view that Hitler imposed the oath on the military is incorrect.{{sfn|Kershaw|1998|p=525}} \n\nThe intention of Blomberg and Reichenau in having the military swear an oath to Hitler was to create a personal special bond between Hitler and the military, which was intended to tie Hitler more tightly towards the military and away from the [[Nazi Party]] (Blomberg later admitted that he did not think through the full implications of the oath at the time).{{sfn|Kershaw|1998|p=525}} As part of his defence of the military \"state within the state\", Blomberg fought against the attempts of the SS to create a military wing.{{sfn|Wheeler-Bennett|p=341}} \n\nThe ''Reichsführer'' SS [[Heinrich Himmler]] repeatedly insisted that the SS needed a military wing to crush any attempt at a Communist revolution before Blomberg conceded that the SS could form a military one, which eventually become the Waffen-SS.{{sfn|Wheeler-Bennett|p=341}} \n\nBlomberg's relations with the SS were badly strained in late 1934-early 1935 when it was discovered that the SS had bugged the offices of the ''Abwehr'' chief, Admiral Wilhelm Canaris, which led Blomberg to warn Hitler the military would not tolerate being spied upon. In response to Blomberg's protests, Hitler gave orders that the SS could not spy upon the military; all members of the military could not be arrested by the police; and cases of suspected \"political unreliability\" within the military were to be investigated solely by the military police.{{sfn|Wheeler-Bennett|pp=341-42}}\n\n==Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces and Minister of War==\nIn 1935, the Ministry of Defence was renamed the Ministry of War; Blomberg also took the title of commander-in-chief of the armed forces. In 1936, the loyal Blomberg was the first [[Field Marshal (Germany)|''Generalfeldmarschall'']] appointed by Hitler. He was also the Commander in Chief of the Armed Forces, the [[Wehrmacht]], although Hitler was the Supreme Commander of the military due to his dictatorial position as the Führer of Germany.{{cn|date=January 2018}} \n\nIn December 1936, a crisis was created within the German decision-making machinery when General [[Wilhelm Faupel]], the chief German officer in Spain started to demand the dispatch of three German divisions to fight in the [[Spanish Civil War]] as the only way for victory, a demand strongly opposed by the Foreign Minister Baron [[Konstantin von Neurath]], who wanted to limit German involvement in Spain.<ref>{{cite book|last=Weinberg|first=Gerhard|year=1970|title=The Foreign Policy of Hitler's Germany: Diplomatic Revolution in Europe|publisher=University of Chicago Press|isbn=978-039103825-7|ref=harv}} pp. 296–97.</ref> \n\nAt a conference held at the ''Reich'' Chancellery on 21 December 1936 attended by Hitler, [[Hermann Göring]], Blomberg, Neurath, General [[Werner von Fritsch]], General [[Walter Warlimont]] and Faupel, Blomberg argued against Faupel, arguing that an all-out German drive for victory in Spain would be too likely to cause a general war before Germany had rearmed properly, and if even it did not, would consume money better spent on military modernization. Blomberg prevailed against Faupel.{{sfn|Weinberg|1970|pp=297-98}}\n\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 183-C10332, Bayreuth, Festspiele, Joseph Goebbels, Werner v.

Hitler argued that because these wars were necessary to provide Germany with ''[[Lebensraum]]'', [[autarky]] and the [[arms race]] with [[France]] and [[UK|Britain]] made it imperative to act before the Western powers developed an insurmountable lead in the arms race.<ref>[[Manfred Messerschmidt|Messerschmidt, Manfred]] \"Foreign Policy and Preparation for War\" from ''[[Germany and the Second World War]]'' Volume I, Clarendon Press: Oxford, Oxfordshire, United Kingdom, 1990, pp. 636–37.<!-- ISSN/ISBN needed --></ref><ref>Carr, William ''Arms, Autarky and Aggression'' Edward Arnold: London, United Kingdom, 1972, pp. 73–78.<!-- ISSN/ISBN needed --></ref>\n\nOf those invited to the conference, objections arose from the Foreign Minister [[Konstantin von Neurath]], Blomberg and the Army Commander in Chief, General [[Werner von Fritsch]] that any German aggression in Eastern Europe was bound to trigger a war with France because of the French alliance system in Eastern Europe, the so-called ''[[cordon sanitaire]]'', and if a Franco-German war broke out, then Britain was almost certain to intervene rather than risk the prospect of France's defeat. Moreover, it was objected that Hitler's assumption that Britain and France would just ignore the projected wars because they had started their re-armament later than Germany was flawed.{{sfn|Weinberg|1970|pp=39-40}}\n\nAccordingly, Fritsch, Blomberg and Neurath advised Hitler to wait until Germany had more time to re-arm before pursuing a high-risk strategy of localised wars that was likely to trigger a general war before Germany was ready (none of those present at the conference had any moral objections to Hitler's strategy, with which they were in basic agreement; only the question of timing divided them).{{sfn|Weinberg|1970|p=342}} \n\nFollowing the [[Hossbach Memorandum]] meeting of November 1937, Blomberg was one of the few who criticised Hitler's plans to go to war no later than 1942, much to Hitler's displeasure, though by early 1938 he changed his mind on this issue.{{cn|date=January 2018}}\n\n==Scandal and fall==\nGöring and Himmler found an opportunity to strike against Blomberg in January 1938, when the general, then 59, married his second wife, Erna Gruhn (1913–1978, sometimes referred to as \"Eva\" or \"Margarete\"). Blomberg had been a widower since the death of his first wife Charlotte in 1932.<ref name=\"Biographical companion\">{{Cite book|last=Nicholls|first=David|year=2000|title=Adolf Hitler: a biographical companion|publisher=ABC-CLIO|location=Santa Barbara, CA|isbn=0-87436-965-7|p=29}}</ref> Gruhn was a 26-year-old typist and secretary, but the Berlin police had a long criminal file on her and her mother, a former prostitute. Among the reports was information that in 1932, Erna Gruhn had posed for pornographic photos.<ref name=\"Background of Erna Gruhn\">{{Cite book|last=Glasman|first=Gabriel|title=Objetivo: Cazar al Lobo|year=2005|publisher=Ediciones Nowtilus, S.L.|location=Madrid, Spain|isbn=970-732-177-6|pages=120-21}}</ref>\n\nThis was reported to the Berlin police chief Count [[Wolf-Heinrich Graf von Helldorf|Wolf-Heinrich von Helldorf]] who went to [[Wilhelm Keitel]] with the file on the new Mrs. Blomberg, saying he was uncertain about what to do. Keitel in his turn, seeing a chance to destroy Blomberg's career, told Helldorf to take the file to Göring, which he did.{{sfn|Wheeler-Bennett|1967|p=366}} \n\nGöring, who had served as best man to Blomberg at the wedding, used the file to argue Blomberg was unfit to serve as a war minister.{{sfn|Faber|2008|pp=46-75}} Göring then informed Hitler, who had been present at the wedding. Hitler ordered Blomberg to annul the marriage to avoid a scandal and to preserve the integrity of the army. The upcoming wedding of one of Blomberg's daughters, Dorothea, would have been threatened by scandal. She was engaged to [[Karl-Heinz Keitel]], eldest son of [[Wilhelm Keitel]]. Blomberg refused to end his marriage but, but when Göring threatened to make her public the pasts of Erna Gruhn and her mother, Blomberg was forced to resign his posts to avoid this, which he did on 27 January 1938. His daughter was married in May the same year.<ref>{{Cite book|author1=Wilhelm Keitel|author2=Walter Görlitz|year=1966|title=The memoirs of Field-Marshal Keitel|publisher=Stein and Day|pp=41, 77}}</ref>\n\nAs a consequence, Hitler took personal command of the military; he retained the title of Supreme Commander, abolished the Ministry of War and in its place, created the High Command of the Armed Forces ([[OKW]]) under his control, to be the supervisory body of the Wehrmacht (armed forces).{{cn|date=January 2018}} Keitel, who would be promoted to the rank of [[Field Marshal]] in 1940, and Blomberg's former right-hand man would be appointed by Hitler as the Chief of the OKW of the Armed Forces. Keitel thus became the de facto Minister of War.{{cn|date=January 2018}}\n\nA few days later, Göring and Himmler accused Commander-in-Chief of the Army [[Werner von Fritsch]] of being a homosexual. Hitler used these opportunities for major reorganization of the ''[[Wehrmacht]]''. Fritsch was later acquitted; together the events became known as the [[Blomberg-Fritsch Affair]].\n\nBlomberg and his wife subsequently went on a honeymoon for a year to the isle of [[Capri]]. Admiral [[Erich Raeder]] decided that Blomberg needed to commit suicide in order to atone for his marriage, and dispatched a Captain von Wangenheim to Italy, who followed the Blombergs around on their honeymoon, persistently and unsuccessfully trying to force Blomberg to commit suicide.{{sfn|Wheeler-Bennett|1967|p=368}} Von Wangenheim at one point even tried to force a gun into Blomberg's hands; but he declined to end his life.<ref>Shirer, William ''The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich'', New York: Simon & Schuster, 1960, p. 314.</ref> Spending [[World War II]] in obscurity, Blomberg was captured by the [[Allies of World War II|Allies]] in 1945. Later he gave evidence at the [[Nuremberg Trials]].\n\n==Imprisonment and death==\nBlomberg's health declined rapidly while he was in detention at [[Nuremberg]], facing the contempt of his former colleagues and the intention of his wife to abandon him. It is possible that he manifested symptoms of cancer as early as 1939. On 12 October 1945 he noted in his diary that he weighed slightly over 72 kilograms. Diagnosed with [[colorectal cancer]] on 20 February 1946, he spent the final weeks of his life resigned and in depression, refusing to eat.{{sfn|Schäfer|2006|pp=200, 206-07}} \n\nBlomberg died on 14 March 1946, and was buried without ceremony in an [[unmarked grave]]. Later, his remains were cremated and interred in his residence in [[Bad Wiessee]].<ref>Samuel W. Mitcham, Jr.: ''Generalfeldmarschall Werner von Blomberg''. In: [[Gerd R.
