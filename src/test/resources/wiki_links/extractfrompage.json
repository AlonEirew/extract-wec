The impact of the season was widespread and ruinous with an estimated 3,913&nbsp;deaths and damage of about $180.7&nbsp;billion, the 2nd costliest on record, only surpassed by the [[2017 Atlantic hurricane season|2017 season]]. Of the storms that made [[landfall (meteorology)|landfall]], five of the season's seven [[Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Scale#Categories|major hurricanes]]<!-- Beta did not make landfall as a major hurricane -->—[[Hurricane Dennis|Dennis]], [[Hurricane Emily (2005)|Emily]], [[Hurricane Katrina|Katrina]], [[Hurricane Rita|Rita]], and [[Hurricane Wilma|Wilma]]—were responsible for most of the destruction. [[Hurricane Stan|Stan]] was the most destructive storm that was not a major hurricane. The [[States of Mexico|Mexican states]] of [[Quintana Roo]] and [[Yucatán (state)|Yucatán]] and the US states of [[Florida]] and [[Louisiana]] were each struck twice by major hurricanes; [[Cuba]], [[the Bahamas]], [[Haiti]], [[Mississippi]], [[Texas]], [[Alabama]], and [[Tamaulipas]] were each struck once and in each case brushed by at least one more. The most catastrophic effects of the season were felt on the [[United States]]' [[Gulf Coast of the United States|Gulf Coast]], where a 30&nbsp;ft (10&nbsp;m) [[storm surge]] from Hurricane Katrina caused devastating flooding that destroyed most structures on the Mississippi coastline; subsequent [[2005 levee failures in Greater New Orleans|levee failures]] in [[New Orleans, Louisiana]] caused by the storm crippled the city. Furthermore, [[Hurricane Stan]] combined with an extratropical system to cause deadly mudslides across Central America, with [[Guatemala]] being hardest-hit.\n\nThe 2005 season was the first to observe more tropical storms and hurricanes in the Atlantic than the West Pacific; on average, the latter experiences 26 tropical storms while the Atlantic only averages 12. This event was repeated in the [[2010 Atlantic hurricane season|2010 season]]; however, the [[2010 Pacific typhoon season|2010 typhoon season]] broke the record for the fewest storms observed in a single year, while the 2005 typhoon season featured near average activity.\n\nThe season officially began on June&nbsp;1, 2005, and lasted until November&nbsp;30, although it effectively persisted into January&nbsp;2006 due to continued storm activity. A record twenty-eight [[tropical cyclone|tropical]] and [[subtropical cyclone|subtropical]] storms formed, of which a record fifteen became hurricanes. Of these, a record-tying seven strengthened into major hurricanes, a record-tying five became Category&nbsp;4 hurricanes and a record four reached Category&nbsp;5 strength, the highest categorization for hurricanes on the [[Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Scale]]. Among these Category&nbsp;5 storms were hurricanes [[Hurricane Katrina|Katrina]] and [[Hurricane Wilma|Wilma]], respectively the second costliest and the most intense (by lowest pressure) Atlantic hurricanes on record. This season was also notable because the list of storm names was used up and six [[Greek letter]] names had to be used.\n\n==Seasonal forecasts==\n{| class=\"toccolours\" cellspacing=0 cellpadding=3 style=\"float:right; clear:right; margin-left:1em; text-align:right;\"\n|+'''Predictions of tropical activity in the 2005 season'''\n|-  style=\"background:#ccf; text-align:center;\"\n||'''Source'''\n||'''Date'''\n||'''<span style=\"font-size: 80%;\">Tropical<br />storms</span>'''\n||'''<span style=\"font-size: 80%;\">Hurricanes</span>'''\n||'''<span style=\"font-size: 80%;\">Major<br />hurricanes</span>'''\n|-\n|align=\"left\"|[[Colorado State University|CSU]]\n|align=\"left\"|''Average <span style=\"font-size: 80%;\">(1950–2000)</span>''<ref name=\"csu-dec2004\">{{cite web |author1=William M.

Gray]] and his associates at [[Colorado State University]] (CSU), and separately by forecasters with the U.S. Government's [[National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration]] (NOAA). Prior to and during the 2005 season, Gray issued four forecasts, each time increasing the predicted level of activity. The NOAA issued two forecasts, one shortly before the season and one two months into the season, drastically increasing the predicted level of activity in the second release. Nonetheless, all forecasts fell far short of the actual activity of the season.\n\n===Preseason forecasts===\nOn December 3, 2004, Gray's team issued its first extended-range forecast for the 2005 season, predicting a slightly above-average season. Additionally, the team predicted a greatly increased chance of a major hurricane striking the [[East Coast of the United States]] and the Florida peninsula. Though the forecast predicted above-average activity, the level predicted was significantly less than the [[2004 Atlantic hurricane season|2004 season]].<ref name=\"csu-dec2004\"/> On April 1, 2005, after confirming that [[El Niño-Southern Oscillation|El Niño]] conditions would not develop, Gray and his team revised the December forecast upward, expecting thirteen tropical storms instead of eleven and seven hurricanes instead of six. In addition, the chance of a storm impacting the United States was raised slightly.<ref>{{cite web\n|author1=William M. Gray  |author2=Philip J.

A few hours later, the storm entered the [[Gulf of Mexico]] and intensified rapidly into a [[Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Scale|Category 5 hurricane]] while crossing the [[Loop Current]] on August 28. Katrina made landfall shortly after 06:00 CST on August 29 near the mouth of the [[Mississippi River]] as an extremely large Category&nbsp;3 hurricane.

Within hours, levees separating [[Lake Pontchartrain]] from New Orleans, Louisiana were breached by the surge, ultimately flooding about 80% of the city. Wind damage was reported well inland, impeding relief efforts. Katrina is estimated to be responsible for at least $125&nbsp;billion (2005&nbsp;USD) in damage, breaking {{anchor|Hurricane Andrew}}[[Hurricane Andrew]]'s record in 1992 and making it the costliest natural disaster in U.S. history until [[Hurricane Harvey|Harvey]] tied it in [[2017 Atlantic Hurricane Season|2017]].

    "text": "{{Use mdy dates|date=December 2015}}\n{{Refimprove|date=February 2014}}\nThis article discusses the year-by-year '''history of the Indianapolis 500''' race.\n\n==Years==\n\n===1909–1910===\nThe first motorcycle and automobile races and demonstration runs are held the Indianapolis Motor Speedway in August 1909. After a series of accidents, the original surface of crushed stone and tar is deemed unsuitable for racing. In the fall of 1909, the entire track is paved in brick, immediately giving the track the nickname \"The Brickyard.\" An exhibition meet is held in December 1909, and racing meets are held throughout the summer of 1910.\n\n:''See [[Indianapolis Motor Speedway race results#Prest-O-Lite Trophy; Wheeler-Schebler Trophy; Other Early Automobile Races (1909-1910)|Indianapolis Motor Speedway race results]]''\n\n===1911–1919===\n'''[[1911 Indianapolis 500|1911]]:''' A historic event in the history of American automobile racing. After two years hosting multiple race meets, the Speedway management decided from 1911 onward to conduct one major racing event per year. With the then-fantastic marathon distance of 500 miles, and a substantial purse, 40 cars qualify. [[Ray Harroun]], an engineer for the Marmon Co. receives the checkered flag at an average speed of just over 74 mph. The inaugural \"International 500-Mile Sweepstakes\" is a rousing success, and becomes an annual Memorial Day tradition, and eventually grows to become one of the most important automobile races in the world.\n\n'''[[1912 Indianapolis 500|1912]]:''' [[Ralph DePalma]]'s [[Mercedes-Benz in motorsport|Mercedes]] breaks its connecting rod after leading 196 laps. [[Joe Dawson (racecar driver)|Joe Dawson]], in a [[National Motor Vehicle Company|National]], wins after leading the only 2 laps of his Indy career. No driver has ever matched DePalma's 196 fruitless laps in the lead, (only not being in the lead for the first two and the last two laps) and only Billy Arnold's 198 lap domination of the 1930 race tops DePalma's time at the front; Dawson's 2 laps led by a winner would be the fewest recorded by a winner until 2011 when Dan Wheldon was officially recorded as having led only the final lap to win the race (when in reality, Wheldon led only the final {{convert|1000|ft}} of the event rather than a \"complete\" lap).\n\n'''[[1913 Indianapolis 500|1913]]:''' A five-story, wooden pagoda-style timing and scoring tower on the inside of the main straightaway gives the Speedway an enduring landmark; the style reflects Speedway President [[Carl G. Fisher|Carl Fisher's]] apparent interest in [[Oriental]] architecture. French born [[Jules Goux]] drinks six bottles of champagne on his way to a record 13-minute, 8-second victory over second place Spencer Wishart. He averages approximately 10 miles per gallon of fuel – and an unknown quantity of champagne per stop.  Goux's victory is the first race, excluding the first, won by a rookie driver.\n\n'''[[1914 Indianapolis 500|1914]]:''' France takes its second consecutive 500 victory, this time with [[René Thomas (France)|René Thomas]], the first occasion for consecutive rookie winners. Also, in a technological breakthrough, inaugural race winner Ray Harroun, in charge of the [[United States Motor Company]] team, develops a fuel-sipping [[carburetor]] that runs on [[kerosene]]. Driver [[Willie Carlson]]'s Maxwell chassis proceeds to run the race to an eventual ninth-place finish on a mere 30 gallons; with the price at $0.06 a gallon, Carlson's total $1.80 fuel bill stands as the most economical performance in motor racing history.\n\n'''[[1915 Indianapolis 500|1915]]:''' Ralph DePalma's Mercedes again begins to slow with connecting rod problems late in the race. This time though he makes it to the finish to win.\n\n'''[[1916 Indianapolis 500|1916]]:''' [[Dario Resta]] wins the race, which was shortened to 300 miles (500&nbsp;km) due to the ongoing war in Europe. The field of 21 cars is the smallest ever. Later in the year, the [[Indianapolis Motor Speedway race results#Harvest Auto Racing Classic (1916)|Harvest Auto Racing Classic]] is also held.\n\n'''1917–1918:''' Race is not held on account of [[World War I]]. Other tracks continue to host smaller events, but Indianapolis voluntarily suspends the race. Though closed to racing, the Speedway is used as an [[airstrip]], serving as a fuel stop between [[United States Air Force|Air Force]] bases in [[Wright-Patterson Air Force Base|Dayton, Ohio]] and [[Chanute Air Force Base|Rantoul, Illinois]].\n\n'''[[1919 Indianapolis 500|1919]]:''' With the track reopened after the war, local [[Indiana]]-born driver [[Howdy Wilcox]] breaks a four-race winning streak by Europeans. There are 19 rookies who start this year's race, the most newcomers in one Indy 500 field (if one discounts the \"all-rookie\" field of 1911).\n\n===1920–1929===\n'''[[1920 Indianapolis 500|1920]]:''' Ralph DePalma suffers another heartbreaking mishap when his magneto fails with 14 laps to go while leading.  [[Gaston Chevrolet]] takes over the lead and goes on to win.  Six months later, Chevrolet is fatally injured in a race at [[Beverly Hills]].  He becomes the first '500' winner to die.\n\n'''[[1921 Indianapolis 500|1921]]:''' [[Tommy Milton]], Gaston Chevrolet's replacement on the Frontenac team, drives through the field from 20th starting position to win his first '500'.  Ralph DePalma again dominates the first half of the race, only to suffer mechanical failure.  DePalma's career record total of 612 laps led will stand for the next 66 years.\n\n'''[[1922 Indianapolis 500|1922]]:''' [[James Anthony Murphy|Jimmy Murphy]] is the first driver to win the race from the pole position.\n\n'''[[1923 Indianapolis 500|1923]]:''' Despite suffering loss of circulation and blistering in his hands due to shrinkage of his tight-fitting, 'White Kid' gloves, Tommy Milton becomes the first driver to win the race twice (Milton was relieved by Howdy Wilcox for laps 103–151).\n\n'''[[1924 Indianapolis 500|1924]]:''' [[Lora L. Corum]]'s car is taken over by [[Joe Boyer]], who goes on to win. Corum wins without leading a single lap in his racing career at Indianapolis, the first driver to do so.\n\n'''[[1925 Indianapolis 500|1925]]:''' The race is won by Ralph DePalma's nephew, and former riding mechanic, [[Peter DePaolo]]. Depaolo was the first to average over {{Convert|100|mi/h|km/h|abbr=on}} on his way to victory.\n\n'''[[1926 Indianapolis 500|1926]]:''' Twenty-three-year-old racing sensation [[Frank Lockhart]] wins the race as a rookie. He is the first winner born in the 20th century. Rain hampered the race, and it was called at the 400-mile mark.\n\n'''[[1927 Indianapolis 500|1927]]:''' Rookie [[George Souders]] wins by eight laps, the largest margin since 1913; consecutive rookie winners occurs for the second time.  Many racing pundits view Souders' race as the most surprising, 'longest-shot' 500-Mile Race win in history until 1987. Souders becomes the first driver to win the full-500-mile race solo, with neither any relief help, nor a riding mechanic.\n\n'''[[1928 Indianapolis 500|1928]]:''' [[Jimmy Gleason]] has a good lead when he stops for water for the radiator on lap 195. A crew member misses the radiator and douses the car's magneto. Gleason is out and [[Louis Meyer]] wins.\n\n'''[[1929 Indianapolis 500|1929]]:''' Louis Meyer stalls on his final pitstop, handing the race to [[Ray Keech]], who is killed in a racing crash just two weeks after the '500'.\n\n===1930–1939===\n'''[[1930 Indianapolis 500|1930]]:''' [[Billy Arnold (racing driver)|Billy Arnold]] takes the lead on lap three and is never headed again. Arnold's 198 laps led in a race has never been bettered.\n\n'''[[1931 Indianapolis 500|1931]]:''' 1930 winner Billy Arnold is 5 laps ahead on lap 162 when his rear axle breaks and Arnold crashes. His wheel flies over a fence and hits and kills 12-year-old Wilbur C. Brink, who is sitting in his garden on Georgetown Road. Arnold and his mechanic are injured. [[Louis Schneider]] leads the remaining laps.\n\n'''[[1932 Indianapolis 500|1932]]:''' [[Fred Frame]] wins the race from 27th starting position, and is the eighth different leader of the race, a record at the time.\n\n'''[[1933 Indianapolis 500|1933]]:''' The largest field to date with 42 starters.  Louis Meyer wins after one of the most violent races ever, with five drivers or mechanics killed and several others seriously injured.  The standard Victory Banquet after the race is not held, and the predominance of safety as chief concern for race organizers begins 'in force'. Prior to the 1933 race, Howdy Wilcox II (no relation to the 1919 winner) was disqualified when officials found out that he was a [[diabetic]].\n\n'''[[1934 Indianapolis 500|1934]]:''' [[Bill Cummings]] wins by 27 seconds from [[Mauri Rose]], the closest ever finish at the time.\n\n'''[[1935 Indianapolis 500|1935]]:''' The newly introduced yellow 'caution' light, requiring drivers to slow and hold position, makes its first appearance in race, to eventual race winner [[Kelly Petillo]]'s advantage as many of the late laps are disrupted by rain, neutralising Petillo's race long battle with [[Rex Mays]] and [[Wilbur Shaw]].\n\n'''[[1936 Indianapolis 500|1936]]:''' Louis Meyer becomes the first driver to win a third time, drink milk (in actuality buttermilk) in Victory Lane, receive the [[Borg-Warner Trophy]], and also receive the pace car as one of his prizes.\n\n'''[[1937 Indianapolis 500|1937]]:''' [[Wilbur Shaw]] leads most of the way but must slow late on to conserve engine oil. [[Ralph Hepburn]] catches Shaw in turn 4 on the final lap, but Shaw steps on the gas and pulls away to win by 2.16 seconds – the closest finish at that time.\n\n'''[[1938 Indianapolis 500|1938]]:''' [[Floyd Roberts]], driving the ill-fated Burd Piston Ring Special, dominates to win by three laps.\n\n'''[[1939 Indianapolis 500|1939]]:''' Defending winner Floyd Roberts, driving the same car he drove into victory circle in 1938, dies in a crash coming off the second turn onto the backstretch on lap 107. Wilbur Shaw wins his second 500, driving a [[Maserati]]. Interesting fact: The Maserati used by Wilbur Shaw was also used by [[Bill Vukovich]] to accomplish his rookie test at the Indianapolis Motor Speedway. [[George Bailey (racing driver)|George Bailey]] became the first driver to compete with a rear-engined car in the Indianapolis 500 when he contested the 1939 race in a Gulf-Miller.<ref>[http://indymotorspeedway.com/v1/500d-40.htm George Bailey, indymotorspeedway.com] Retrieved 26 May 2016</ref>\n\n===1940–1949===\n'''[[1940 Indianapolis 500|1940]]''': Wilbur Shaw becomes the second three-time winner and the first to win two in a row in the same Maserati he drove to victory the previous year.  The last quarter of the distance is run under the caution flag due to rain.\n\n'''[[1941 Indianapolis 500|1941]]''': A fire on race morning destroys part of the garage area and one of the qualified cars.  The start is delayed by one hour because of the fire.  Wilbur Shaw dominates again, but on lap 152, a wheel collapses, sending Shaw's car into the first turn wall.  The wheel is believed to have been one Shaw identified before the race as faulty, and had marked it as not to be used.  Water from the hoses battling the garage fire apparently washed off the markings and the wheel was put on during the last pit stop.  Mauri Rose, whose pole-winning Maserati dropped out early, took over teammate [[Floyd Davis]]'s car on lap 72 and drove up through the pack to win.  This was the second and last time to date that there were co-winners.\n\n'''1942–1945''': The Speedway is shut down for the duration of [[World War II]]—almost.  Sometime in late autumn of 1944, Wilbur Shaw participates in a special tire test for [[Firestone Tire and Rubber Company|Firestone]] at the track.  He is dismayed by the condition of the facility, and, after talking to track owner [[Eddie Rickenbacker]], sets out single-handedly to find a buyer to rejuvenate the speedway.  On November 14, 1945, [[Tony Hulman]] purchases the track and begins a six-month crash renovation program to revive the 500-mile race in 1946.\n    \n'''[[1946 Indianapolis 500|1946]]''': The first post-war '500' is a box-office smash, with massive traffic jams of spectators still entering the gates long after the race starts.  Most of the race cars show the effects of sitting unused for almost five years, and mechanical attrition is extremely heavy.  [[George Robson (racing driver)|George Robson]], driving a nine-year-old Thorne Engineering Special, survives the carnage to win by 44 seconds over rookie [[Jimmy Jackson (racing driver)|Jimmy Jackson]].\n\n'''[[1947 Indianapolis 500|1947]]''': Mauri Rose and rookie teammate [[Bill Holland]] dominate the race in their twin Blue Crown Spark Plug Specials.  Holland, who is well ahead in the late stages, obeys a pit signal to slow down and preserve the car for the finish.  Rose gets the same signal, but continues to charge ahead and overtakes Holland with seven laps to go.  Rose goes on to win, to the dismay of Holland, who thought he had been a lap ahead.  A pre-race dispute between track management and a drivers association results in only 30 cars lining up on race day, instead of the usual 33.\n\n'''[[1948 Indianapolis 500|1948]]''': Rose and Holland repeat their one-two performance of the previous year, this time without the controversy.  [[Ted Horn]] finishes fourth in Wilbur Shaw's old Maserati, completing a run of nine consecutive races in which he is fourth or better, although he never wins.\n\n'''[[1949 Indianapolis 500|1949]]''': After pole-sitter [[Duke Nalon]] crashes out spectacularly in the [[Novi, Michigan|Novi]], the race settles down to a repeat of [[1947 Indianapolis 500|1947]], only this time Bill Holland won't be caught napping.  Mauri Rose tries to catch him anyway, but a broken magneto strap takes him out of second place with eight laps remaining.  Holland cruises home the winner.  It's the last victory for a front-wheel drive car at Indianapolis.\n\n===1950–1959===\n'''[[1950 Indianapolis 500|1950]]:''' The Indianapolis 500 was part of the Formula 1 World Championship calendar from 1950–1960. A rumor circulated at race morning, that [[Johnnie Parsons]]' engine had an irreparable crack. During the race, his hard charging performance sees him leading, and picking up lap leader prizes. At 345 miles (555&nbsp;km) the rain comes, and Parsons is declared the winner as the race is called at lap 138. [[Clark Gable]] and [[Barbara Stanwyck]] film scenes from the movie ''[[To Please a Lady]]'' during the race.\n\n'''[[1951 Indianapolis 500|1951]]:''' Four days after winning the 500 (and becoming the first to do so in less than four hours) [[Lee Wallard]] is severely burned in a sprint car race and lives the rest of his life unable to perspire properly and without the strength to drive a car.\n\n'''[[1952 Indianapolis 500|1952]]:''' [[Bill Vukovich]] leads 150 laps until his steering pin breaks on lap 192. He stopped the car by brushing it against the outside wall, a move which prevented other cars from becoming involved in the sudden incident. Twenty-two-year-old [[Troy Ruttman]] takes the checkered flag, the youngest-ever winner. On the pole for the '52 race was [[Fred Agabashian]]'s Diesel-powered racer that succumbed to supercharger trouble on lap 71.\n\n'''[[1953 Indianapolis 500|1953]]:''' On one of the hottest days on record for the running of the 500, [[Bill Vukovich]] leads 195 laps and cruises to a win by nearly three laps over 1952 [[List of Indianapolis 500 Rookies of the Year|rookie of the year]] [[Art Cross]]. Vukovich wins without relief help in a race that sees one entry being driven by as many as five separate drivers, and suffers the death of driver [[Carl Scarborough]] due to heat prostration.\n\n'''[[1954 Indianapolis 500|1954]]:''' Picking up where he left off, [[Bill Vukovich]] wins again by one lap over [[Jimmy Bryan]], after taking the lead for the final time just past the halfway point.  Incredibly, for the second straight year one entry on race day is driven by five separate drivers, in temperatures only just below the previous year's record.\n\n'''[[1955 Indianapolis 500|1955]]:''' After two wins and 485 laps led of a possible 656 (74%), Bill Vukovich is killed on lap 57 after crashing out of the lead. Rodger Ward broke a rear axle and a back marker tangled with him in front of Vukovich, whose car hits them and vaults over the backstretch wall into a car park.\n[[Bob Sweikert]] wins after [[Art Cross]] blows his engine on lap 169 and [[Don Freeland]] loses drive on lap 179. Sweikert dies in a sprint car race a year later. Interesting fact: Sweikert built the Offenhauser engine that brought him the victory, while his car owner (AJ Watson) was at his wife's bedside while she was in labor.\n\n'''[[1956 Indianapolis 500|1956]]:''' [[American Automobile Association|AAA]] drops out of sanctioning racing after the 1955 Vukovich crash and public outcry that briefly followed, and the tragedy at [[24 Hours of Le Mans|Le Mans]] that same year, so [[United States Automobile Club|USAC]] is formed to sanction Indianapolis style racing. Torrential rains flood the facility the week of the race and threaten to postpone, or outright cancel the race. Track superintendent Clarence Cagle pulls off what becomes known as \"Cagle's miracle\" and has the track cleaned up in time for race morning. [[Pat Flaherty (racing driver)|Pat Flaherty]] wins.\n\n'''[[1957 Indianapolis 500|1957]]:''' After thirteen years of trying, [[Sam Hanks]] finally wins the 500, and then, amidst tears, becomes the second winner, after [[Ray Harroun]] in 1911, to announce his retirement in victory lane.  Hanks' win comes in a radical \"lay-down\" roadster chassis design created by engineer [[George Salih]] that, with the engine tilting 72-degrees to the right, gives the car a profile of a mere {{Convert|21|in|mm}} off the ground.  Salih builds the car next to his California home, and is rewarded with victory as both designer and owner after stepping out on a financial limb in entering the car himself.\n\n'''[[1958 Indianapolis 500|1958]]:''' A huge wreck in turn three on the opening lap wipes out several cars, and driver [[Pat O'Connor (racing driver)|Pat O'Connor]] is fatally injured. [[Jimmy Bryan]] goes on to win in the same car Sam Hanks drove to victory the previous year. Little-known rookie [[A. J. Foyt]] spins out and finishes 16th.\n\n'''[[1959 Indianapolis 500|1959]]:''' A record sixteen cars finish the entire {{Convert|500|mi|km}} as [[Rodger Ward]] holds off [[Jim Rathmann]] for the win.\n\n===1960–1969===\n'''[[1960 Indianapolis 500|1960]]''': [[Jim Rathmann]] and Rodger Ward resume their duel from last year, trading the lead fourteen times in the last 200 miles.  After three-second-place finishes, Rathmann finally prevails when Ward has to slow down to save his tires with three laps to go.  There are 29 lead changes in all, a record that will stand for over 50 years.  Rookie [[Jim Hurtubise]] shatters the track record in qualifying at over 149 miles per hour, coming within 16/100ths of a second of turning the first 150&nbsp;mph lap at the Speedway.\n\n'''[[1961 Indianapolis 500|1961]]''': The Golden Anniversary of the first '500' starts with 82-year-old [[Ray Harroun]] taking a parade lap in his winning Marmon Wasp of [[1911 Indianapolis 500|1911]].  After several different drivers, including newcomer [[Parnelli Jones]], take turns leading, the race comes down a battle between [[A. J. Foyt]] and [[Eddie Sachs]], which goes to Foyt when Sachs pits for a right rear tire with only three laps to go.  Formula 1 champion [[Jack Brabham]] finishes ninth in a rear-engine Cooper-Climax, a prelude of things to come.\n\n'''[[1962 Indianapolis 500|1962]]''': Parnelli Jones breaks the 150&nbsp;mph barrier to win the pole, and dominates the first 300 miles on race day.  However, his brakes fail and he has to slow down.  Rodger Ward takes over the lead and wins his second '500' by 11 seconds over teammate [[Len Sutton]].\n \n'''[[1963 Indianapolis 500|1963]]''': Parnelli Jones finishes the job he started last year, leading 167 of the 200 laps to win in his front-engine roadster \"Old Calhoun\", in spite of a late-race oil leak which almost gets him the black flag.  Formula 1 champion-to-be [[Jim Clark]] comes in second in a rear-engine Lotus-Ford, heralding the British Invasion of the 500 and Indy-car racing in general.\n\n'''[[1964 Indianapolis 500|1964]]''': Rear-engine, [[Ford]]-powered cars sweep the front row, with Jim Clark raising the track record by over seven miles an hour.  Tragedy strikes on Lap 2 when [[Dave MacDonald]] hits the wall coming out of Turn 4 and his car explodes in a huge fireball.  [[Eddie Sachs]] and several others pile into the accident, which stops the race for nearly two hours.  Both Sachs and MacDonald are killed.  When the race resumes, the fast but fragile rear-engine cars fall apart, leaving [[A. J. Foyt]] to pick up the pieces, as he becomes a two-time winner.  Foyt's roadster is the last front-engine machine to win the Indianapolis 500.\n\n'''[[1965 Indianapolis 500|1965]]''': [[Scotland]]'s [[Jim Clark]] leads 190 of 200 laps to become the first non-American winner since [[1916 Indianapolis 500|1916]]. His Lotus-Ford is the first rear-engine winning car, and the first to average more than 150 miles per hour for the entire distance (150.686), just three years after the first ''single lap'' was turned at 150.  [[Parnelli Jones]] finishes second and rookie [[Mario Andretti]] is third.\n\n'''[[1966 Indianapolis 500|1966]]''': A huge pile-up at the start takes out 11 cars, including those of A. J. Foyt and [[Dan Gurney]], but, thankfully, there are no serious injuries.  Only seven cars are left running in the end, with [[Graham Hill]] edging out Jim Clark by 41 seconds in a Battle of Britains.  Some people think there was a scoring error and that Clark had actually won, but Clark's team does not protest.\n\n'''[[1967 Indianapolis 500|1967]]''': [[Andy Granatelli]] and his brothers bring a radical new turbine-powered car to the Speedway this year.  [[Parnelli Jones]] absolutely dominates the field in it, and leads by almost a lap when a bearing in the gearbox fails with just three and a half laps to go.  [[A. J. Foyt]] weaves his way through a multi-car accident on the final straightaway to win his third '500'.  The race is a two-day affair for the first time when rain postpones the event after only 18 laps on May 30.  Shortly after the race, USAC officials change the rules regarding turbines to reduce the Granatellis' advantage.\n\n'''[[1968 Indianapolis 500|1968]]''': The Granatellis return with even more turbines this year, in new wedge-shaped [[Lotus Cars|Lotus]] chassis.  They take the first two starting spots with record speeds of over 170&nbsp;mph.  However, on race day, [[Bobby Unser]] in a turbocharged [[Offenhauser]]-powered car, is able to take their measure, leading 127 laps.  Unser's path to victory is cleared when [[Joe Leonard]]'s turbine breaks its fuel pump shaft with just nine laps to go while leading.  USAC then issues further restrictions on turbines, rendering any future such engines uncompetitive.\n\n'''[[1969 Indianapolis 500|1969]]''': Andy Granatelli abandons the turbines and joins forces with [[Mario Andretti]] in a new four-wheel drive [[Lotus Cars|Lotus]] with a turbocharged Ford engine.  But after the car is destroyed in a practice crash, the team qualifies a conventional two-wheel drive Hawk built by crew chief [[Clint Brawner]].  For the only time in Andretti's Indy career, all the breaks finally go his way, as he wins by nearly two laps over [[Dan Gurney]].  The long-suffering Granatelli plants a kiss on Mario's cheek in Victory Lane.\n\n===1970–1979===\n[[1970 Indianapolis 500|1970]] · [[1971 Indianapolis 500|1971]] · [[1972 Indianapolis 500|1972]] · [[1973 Indianapolis 500|1973]] · [[1974 Indianapolis 500|1974]] · [[1975 Indianapolis 500|1975]] · [[1976 Indianapolis 500|1976]] · [[1977 Indianapolis 500|1977]] · [[1978 Indianapolis 500|1978]] · [[1979 Indianapolis 500|1979]]\n\n===1980–1989===\n[[1980 Indianapolis 500|1980]] · [[1981 Indianapolis 500|1981]] · [[1982 Indianapolis 500|1982]] · [[1983 Indianapolis 500|1983]] · [[1984 Indianapolis 500|1984]] · [[1985 Indianapolis 500|1985]] · [[1986 Indianapolis 500|1986]] · [[1987 Indianapolis 500|1987]] · [[1988 Indianapolis 500|1988]] · [[1989 Indianapolis 500|1989]]\n\n===1990–1999===\n[[1990 Indianapolis 500|1990]] · [[1991 Indianapolis 500|1991]] · [[1992 Indianapolis 500|1992]] · [[1993 Indianapolis 500|1993]] · [[1994 Indianapolis 500|1994]] · [[1995 Indianapolis 500|1995]] · [[1996 Indianapolis 500|1996]] · [[1997 Indianapolis 500|1997]] · [[1998 Indianapolis 500|1998]] · [[1999 Indianapolis 500|1999]]\n\n===2000–2009===\n[[2000 Indianapolis 500|2000]] · [[2001 Indianapolis 500|2001]] · [[2002 Indianapolis 500|2002]] · [[2003 Indianapolis 500|2003]] · [[2004 Indianapolis 500|2004]] · [[2005 Indianapolis 500|2005]] · [[2006 Indianapolis 500|2006]] · [[2007 Indianapolis 500|2007]] · [[2008 Indianapolis 500|2008]] · [[2009 Indianapolis 500|2009]]\n\n===2010–2019===\n[[2010 Indianapolis 500|2010]] · [[2011 Indianapolis 500|2011]] · [[2012 Indianapolis 500|2012]] · [[2013 Indianapolis 500|2013]] · [[2014 Indianapolis 500|2014]] · [[2015 Indianapolis 500|2015]] · [[2016 Indianapolis 500|2016]] · [[2017 Indianapolis 500|2017]]\n\n==Eras==\nDuring the over-century long history of the [[Indianapolis 500]] and [[Indianapolis Motor Speedway]], numerous recognized eras have been established by historians, media, competitors, and fans. As the race follows the infancy of the automobile through the 20th century, and into the 21st century, sharp increases in technology, car design, and speed, have generally shaped the eras, which loosely follow decade patterns. Organizational changes and disputes, varying levels of popularity, increased media coverage, world wars, personalities, participants, traditions, famous races, and tragedies, have all been defining factors to establish the boundaries of the respective eras.\n\n===Fisher Era===\nFrom the opening of the track (1909) and the [[1911 Indianapolis 500|first 500]] (1911), through 1927. [[Carl G. Fisher]] and partners envisioned a \"proving ground\" for the budding automobile industry. The very early years of the 500 saw the track in its original \"proving ground\" intent, but the competition soon became the primary focus. Numerous makes and models of local, national, and international car companies participated, with the cars more conforming to the original specifications of being essentially stripped-down passenger vehicles. [[Riding mechanic]]s were the norm (with the noteworthy exception of [[Ray Harroun]] in [[1911 Indianapolis 500|1911]]).\n\nThe [[AAA Contest Board]] sanctioned the events at the Speedway, and the race ultimately became part of a [[American Championship car racing|National Championship]] of drivers. The discipline of [[American Championship car racing|Championship Car]] racing became a national sport, with the Indianapolis 500 as its marquee event. A maximum 33-car field was established, based on a 1919 mandate by AAA officials that of 400 feet of track per car.\n\nAfter [[World War I]] and during the [[Roaring Twenties]], the formula quickly evolved into purpose-built racing machines. Small-block engines (91 cu. in) was the standard, riding mechanics were dropped, and the speeds quickly rose. [[Peter DePaolo]] became the first driver to average 100&nbsp;mph for the 500 miles in 1925. Fisher sold his interests in the track in late 1927.\n\n===Rickenbacker Era===\nFrom 1928–1941. [[Eddie Rickenbacker]] purchased the Speedway in 1928, and ushered in a new era. Rules changes were abound, which included such things as the reinstatement of [[riding mechanic]]s, time trials expanded to 10-lap runs (up from 4 laps), and engine rules which increased displacement and prohibited supercharging. After many years of small-block, purpose-built machines, the specifications once again reflected the very early years. The rule changes were in an effort to lure back the passenger car manufacturers, and have the machines more closely resemble cars available to the motoring public. Larger fields were allowed, to as many as 42 cars (up from the traditional 33). The Rickenbacker era coincided with the [[Great Depression]], although the Speedway did not experience significant financial peril, and the engine displacement changes were not in response to the stock market crash.\n\nSeveral Indy traditions were born during this time, including the first bottle of milk in victory lane, the first presentation of the [[Borg-Warner Trophy]], and the tradition of presenting the race winner with the keys to the pace car. Ended with the onset of [[World War II]] (Pearl Harbor). The Rickenbacker Era is considered the deadliest period of 500 history, with 24 fatalities amongst competitors and spectators. In response to the numerous fatal accidents, rule changes and track improvements slowly began to be implemented in the interest of safety.\n\nThe first major national radio coverage of the race occurred in 1928. By 1939, [[Mutual Broadcasting System]] was covering the race live to various affiliates across the country.\n\n===Post World War II era===\nFrom 1946-early 1950s. Immediately following World War II, the Speedway was sold to [[Tony Hulman]]. He swiftly renovated the track which had fallen into a [[1942 Indianapolis 500|state of disrepair]] during the war years. It is a brief period, marked by a mix of mostly older cars. Auto racing began to rebuild as a sport after being banned during World War II, primarily due to rationing.\n\nBy this time, the typical pre-war image of race car drivers as [[Stunt performer|daredevils]] or reckless stunt drivers had faded. Likewise the mechanics' image as \"grease monkeys\" or low-level tradesmen faded, as the sophistication of engines and chassis increased. Numerous drivers and mechanics during this time had been involved in the war effort, either stateside or abroad. The legitimacy of the sport recognized on a national level began to grow.\n\nNational radio coverage of the race began to grow at a fast rate, first by [[Mutual Broadcasting System|Mutual]], and later as a result of the formation of the [[Indianapolis Motor Speedway Radio Network]].\n\n===Roadster Era===\nFrom 1952 to the mid-1960s. Considered by many as the \"golden era\"<ref>{{cite web|last1=Oreovicz|first1=John|title=Indy at 100: The '50s golden era|url=http://www.espn.com/racing/racing/indycar/indy500/2011/columns/story?id=6526703&columnist=oreovicz_john|publisher=ESPN|accessdate=January 17, 2017}}</ref> of the Indy 500, it is highlighted by the participation of the front-engined [[Roadster (automobile)#Championship race cars|Roadsters]]. The first \"roadster\" is regarded to have been built and entered by Frank Kurtis in 1952.[http://sports.espn.go.com/rpm/racing/indycar/indy500/2011/columns/story?columnist=oreovicz_john&id=6542570]\n\nDuring this time (1950–1960), the Indy 500 awarded points towards the [[List of Formula One World Drivers' Champions|World Championship of Drivers]]. However, very few European entries even made an attempt to race at Indy.\n\nNoteworthy moments include the emotional victory by [[Sam Hanks]] in 1957, as well as the tragic death of two-time winner [[Bill Vukovich]]. The famous [[1960 Indianapolis 500|1960]] duel between [[Rodger Ward]] and [[Jim Rathmann]] set the race record for the most lead changes in Indy 500 history, a record that remarkably would not be broken until 2012. Indy legend [[A. J. Foyt]] debuted in 1958, and won his first 500 in 1961. In the fall of 1961, the last of the remaining original brick pavement was paved over in asphalt, and in 1962 [[Parnelli Jones]] famously broke the 150 mph barrier.\n\n===Rear-engine revolution===\nThe 1960s. Sometimes referred to as the \"British Invasion\" or the \"Decade of Innovation.\" In 1961, [[Jack Brabham]] arrived at Indy with the first European, grand prix style, rear-engined machine. Against a field of venerable [[Offenhauser]]-powered roadsters, Brabham's car was considered diminutive and underpowered, however, it experienced exceptional handling in the relatively flat corners. The mechanical advantages of rear-engined cars were quickly realized, and rapidly began to displace their front-engined counterparts in the starting field. In 1965 [[Jim Clark]] won in a rear-engined machine, and another front-engined car would never win again. By the end of the decade, the movement had swiftly taken over the sport, and in 1969, not a single front-engined car would qualify.\n\nIn 1965, [[ABC Sports]] carried the race for the first time on ''[[Wide World of Sports (U.S. TV series)|Wide World of Sports]]'', ushering in a new era of television coverage at Indy.\n\nAfter a fiery fatal crash in 1964, USAC crafted rules to discourage, and eventually ban, the use of gasoline as a fuel.\n\n===Decade of Legends===\nThe 1970s. After bolt-on wings started being allowed in 1972, speeds quickly climbed. Drivers went from laps in the 160&nbsp;mph range a few years earlier, to flirting with the elusive and daunting 200&nbsp;mph barrier. Turbocharged engines were the powerplants of choice, downforce levels increased substantially, and wide slick tires were now being used. It was both an entertaining spectacle for the fans, as well as a disaster waiting to happen, as safety features were not prepared for the rapid increase in speeds. After a tragic race in 1973, sweeping changes were made starting in 1974, both to the cars and the track itself. Tom Sneva broke the elusive 200&nbsp;mph barrier in 1977.\n\nThis era is also associated with the establishment of numerous Indy \"legends.\" Drivers such as [[A. J. Foyt]], [[Mario Andretti]], [[Al Unser]], [[Bobby Unser]], [[Johnny Rutherford]], [[Gordon Johncock]], and many others, reached the peak of their respective careers during this period. Future \"legends\" [[Tom Sneva]] and [[Rick Mears]] also began their careers during this decade. While the decade was dominated by American drivers and American-based teams, success was not exclusive to just U.S.-based entries. [[McLaren]] was among the European entrants that experienced success, and towards the end of the decade, the venerable [[Offenhauser]] engine was now being seriously challenged by the British-built [[Cosworth DFV#DFX|Cosworth]].\n\nA. J. Foyt became the first four-time winner of the 500, while [[Janet Guthrie]] became the first female to qualify for the race. The track itself gained notoriety for increasing attendance, television exposure, and the \"Snakepit,\" a gathering place in the infield for known for revelry.\n\n===CART era===\nFrom 1979–1995. After the formation of [[Champ Car|CART]] in [[1979 IndyCar season|1979]], the first open wheel [[1979 Indianapolis 500#USAC/CART \"Split\"|\"split\"]] came about and was the focus of the very early 1980s. By 1983, a relative harmony in the sport settled, and saw the season of events sanctioned by CART, and the Indianapolis 500 itself sanctioned by [[United States Auto Club|USAC]]. The field of cars and drivers would be composed primarily of CART-based teams and various one-off (\"Indy only\") entries.\n\nThe decade saw the concept of \"customer chassis\" take over the series, as well as exclusive engine leases creep into the competition. Nearly all engine and chassis manufacturers were foreign-based, to a point where by [[1987 Indianapolis 500|1987]], not a single chassis entered was built in the United States. Manufactures such as [[March Engineering|March]], [[Lola Cars|Lola]], and [[Reynard]] were the chassis of choice on the open market, with other more exclusive chassis ([[Penske Racing|Penske]] and [[Galmer]]) also experiencing success.\n\nThis period also saw a sharp increase in the number of foreign-born competitors, going from as few as two, to as many as nineteen by 1995. While this was a booming period of increasing popularity both nationwide and worldwide, the dwindling number of American-born competitors was a point of contention for some fans and owners.{{Who|date=January 2015}} In addition, the feeder series and \"ladder\" for arriving at Indy evolved from [[United States Automobile Club|USAC]] [[Sprint car racing|sprints]] and [[Midget car racing|midgets]] to predominantly [[Formula racing|formula-style]] [[road racing]]. Many of the top drivers on the circuit were now moving up from such disciplines as [[Can-Am]], [[Sports Car Club of America|SCCA]] [[Formula Super Vee|Super Vee]], [[Atlantic Championship|Atlantics]], [[Indy Lights]], and [[International Motor Sports Association|IMSA]].\n\n[[Rick Mears]] won the Indy 500 four times (1979, 1984, 1988, 1991) during the CART era, all for [[Penske Racing]]. The Penske team itself was one of the most successful teams during the era, winning nine races from 1979-1994. [[Al Unser Jr.]] became the first second-generation driver to win, while his father [[Al Unser Sr.]] won the race for the fourth time himself in 1987, in doing so, becoming the oldest driver to win. Speeds increased from just over 200&nbsp;mph in the late 1970s, to over 230&nbsp;mph by 1992. In 1986, [[Bobby Rahal]] became the first driver ever to complete the 500 miles in less than three hours, at an average speed of 170.722&nbsp;mph.\n\nStarting in 1986, ABC Sports began carrying the race live on network television. In addition, the radio network swelled to over 1,200 affiliates nationwide.\n\n===IRL / \"Split\" Era===\nFrom 1996–2007. The [[IndyCar|IRL]] was formed in 1996, starting what was considered a \"split\" in the sport of Indy car racing. Speedway president [[Tony George]] founded the series with stated goals of implementing cost saving measures and to increase American driver participation. [[Champ Car|CART]]-based teams boycotted the race for four years, considering the move a \"power grab\" by George, and citing several organizational disagreements.\n\nPopularity in the sport of Indy car racing and the Indy 500 saw a visible decline in attendance, television ratings, and positive media coverage. A new formula of normally-aspirated machines was introduced for 1997, and the \"original\" or \"Old School IRL\" era ran to roughly 2002. By 2003, most of the top CART-based teams and manufacturers had defected to the IRL, and likewise the landscape slowly receded back to resemble that of the CART era. Later, manufacturers began to pull out of the series, leaving [[Dallara]] and [[Honda]] as the only chassis and engine suppliers, respectively. A ''de facto'' \"spec car\" era began in 2006, but equipment shortages were not much of an issue going forward. Also in 2006, the series began experimenting with ethanol fuel blends.\n\nA major event off the track during this era was the implementation of the [[Tobacco Master Settlement Agreement|MSA]], which effectively ended [[Tobacco industry|tobacco]] [[Tobacco advertising#Sponsorship|sponsorship]] in the sport.\n\n===Unification Era===\nFrom 2003 (or 2008) through 2011. In 2008, the [[INDYCAR|Indy Racing League]] and [[Champ Car]] completed an organizational unification, which marked the first time since 1978 that the sport of [[American Championship car racing|Indy car racing]] would be contested under a single sanctioning banner. The newly reorganized series would compete under the name IndyCar Series.\n\nThe seeds of unification and the end of the \"[[1996 Indianapolis 500#IRL/CART split|split]]\" began as early as [[2000 Indianapolis 500|2000]], when CART-based teams began crossing over to compete at Indy with the IRL regulars in one-off entries. The unified era can also be traced back more specifically to [[2003 Indianapolis 500|2003]], when most of the top CART-based teams and manufacturers defected to the IRL permanently and returned to Indy full-time.\n\nThe Unification Era spans specifically from either [[2003 IndyCar Series|2003]] or [[2008 IndyCar Series|2008]] through [[2011 IndyCar Series|2011]]. By the time of the formal 2008 unification, it was contested with the aforementioned \"spec car\", the [[Dallara#Third generation (IR-03 / IR-05)|Dallara IR03/05]] powered by the normally aspirated [[Honda Performance Development|Honda V-8 engines]]. With the sudden influx of former [[Champ Car]] teams and drivers, and an abundance of available rolling chassis, fields briefly grew. For a few years, bumping returned to time trials, and the era was highlighted by the [[2011 Indianapolis 500|100th Anniversary]] of the Indianapolis 500 in [[2011 IndyCar Series|2011]].\n\nThe end of the IR-03/05 \"spec\" era came at the conclusion of the [[2011 IndyCar Series|2011 IndyCar season]]. It ended, however, tragically at [[2011 IZOD IndyCar World Championship|Las Vegas]].\n\n===DW-12 Era===\nSince 2012. For the 2012 IndyCar season, the series rolled out a [[2012 IndyCar Series#The ICONIC Project|new chassis and engine formula]], bringing back turbocharged engines and multiple engine manufacturers.  [[Honda Performance Development|Honda]], [[Chevrolet Indy V6|Chevrolet]], and [[Lotus Cars|Lotus]] provided engines, though Lotus withdrew after only one season. The [[Dallara DW12]] chassis was fitted with aero kits from Dallara from 2012-2014, then from Honda and Chevrolet respectively, from 2015-2017. A universal Dallara aero kit will be used beginning in 2018. Speeds began to climb again, surpassing the 230&nbsp;mph barrier, but not breaking existing qualifying records that were set in [[1996 Indianapolis 500|1996]]. The era was highlighted by the much-anticipated [[2016 Indianapolis 500|100th Running]] of the Indianapolis 500 in 2016.\n\nThe era has been marked with an increase in competition on the track, with an all-time record of 68 lead changes set in 2013, and a record 15 different leaders in 2017. The 2014 race saw a 149-lap caution free stint from the start, and the 2013 and 2014 races are the two fastest Indy 500 races in history. In 2013, [[Tony Kanaan]] averaged 187.433&nbsp;mph, the fastest 500 in history.\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{Indy 500}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Indianapolis 500 By Year}}\n[[Category:Indianapolis 500|Year by year]]\n[[Category:Years in Indiana]]",

In April 1904, he married Charlotte Hellmich. The couple had five children.\n\n==Military career==\n{{moresources|section|date=January 2018}}\nAfter graduating in 1907, Blomberg entered the [[German General Staff|General Staff]] in 1908. Serving with distinction on the [[Western Front (World War I)|Western Front]] during the [[World War I|First World War]], Blomberg was awarded the ''[[Pour le Mérite]]''.{{cn|date=January 2018}}\n\nIn 1920, Blomberg was appointed chief of staff of the Döberitz Brigade, and in 1921 was made chief of staff of the [[Stuttgart]] Army Area. In 1925, Blomberg was made chief of army training by General [[Hans von Seeckt]]. By 1927, Blomberg was a [[major-general]] and chief of the [[Truppenamt|Troop Office]] ({{lang-de|Truppenamt}}), which was the thinly disguised [[German General Staff]] forbidden by the Treaty of Versailles.<ref name=\"Paehler 2009\">{{cite web|last=Paehler|first=Katrin|title=General ohne Eigenschaften?|publisher=H-Net Online|date=June 2009|url=http://www.h-net.org/reviews/showrev.php?id=24691|accessdate=2013-05-05}}</ref> \n\nIn 1928, Blomberg visited the [[Soviet Union]], where he was much impressed by the high status of the [[Red Army]], and left as a convinced believer in the value of totalitarian [[dictatorship]] as the prerequisite for military power.<ref>{{cite book|last=Wheeler-Bennett|first=John|year=1967|title=The Nemesis of Power: The German Army in Politics 1918–1945|location=London, UK|publisher=Macmillan|pp=295–96|ref=harv}}</ref> \n\nThis was part of a broader shift on the part of the German military to the idea of a [[totalitarian]] ''Wehrstaat'' (Defence State) which, starting in the mid-1920s, had become popular with officers. The German historian [[Eberhard Kolb]] wrote that:{{bquote|...from the mid-1920s onwards the Army leaders had developed and propagated new social conceptions of a militarist kind, tending towards a fusion of the military and civilian sectors and ultimately a totalitarian military state (''Wehrstaat'').<ref>Kolb, Eberhard ''The Weimar Republic'' London: Routledge, 2005, p. 173</ref>}}\n\nBlomberg's visit to the Soviet Union in 1928 had the effect of confirming his views about totalitarian powers being the greatest military powers. Blomberg believed the next world war, like the previous one, would become a [[total war]], requiring the full mobilisation of German society and economy by the state, and that a totalitarian state would be most apt for effectively preparing society militarily and economically for war in peacetime.<ref name=\"Paehler 2009\"/> Like the rest of Nazi Germany's military elite, Blomberg took it for granted that for Germany to achieve the \"world power status\" that it had sought (but failed to obtain) in the First World War would require another war, and that such a war would be a total war of a highly mechanised, industrial type.{{sfn|Müller|1987|p=26}}\n\nAfter arguing with General [[Kurt von Schleicher]] in 1929, however, Blomberg was removed from his post and made military commander of [[East Prussia]]. In 1929, Schleicher came into conflict with Blomberg at the ''[[Truppenamt]]''. In early 1929, Schleicher had started a policy of \"frontier defense\" (''Grenzschutz'') under which the ''[[Reichswehr]]'' would stockpile arms in secret depots and start training volunteers in excess of the limits imposed by Versailles in the eastern parts of Germany facing Poland; in order to avoid incidents with France, there was to be no policy of ''Grenzschutz'' in the western parts of Germany.<ref>{{cite book|last=Patch|first=William L.|year=2006|title=Heinrich Bruning and the Dissolution of the Weimar Republic|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-052102541-6|ref=harv}}, p. 50.</ref> \n\nThe French planned to withdraw from the Rhineland in June 1930 — five years earlier than what the Treaty of Versailles had called for  — and Schleicher wanted no violations of Versailles that might seem to threaten France before the French left the Rhineland. When Blomberg, whom Schleicher personally disliked, insisted on extending ''Grenzschutz'' to border areas with France, in August 1929 Schleicher leaked the news to the press that Blomberg had attended armed maneuvers by volunteers in [[Westphalia]].{{sfn|Patch|2006|p=51}} [[List of German defence ministers|Defence Minister]] General [[Wilhelm Groener]], called Blomberg to Berlin to explain himself. Blomberg expected Schleicher to stick to the traditional ''Reichswehr'' policy of denying everything, and was shocked to see Schleicher instead attack him in front of Groener as a man who had recklessly exposed Germany to the risk of providing the French with an excuse to stay on in the Rhineland until 1935.{{sfn|Patch|2006|p=51}} \n\nAs a result, Blomberg was demoted from command of the ''Truppenamt'' and sent to command a division in East Prussia.{{sfn|Patch|2006|p=51}} Blomberg would later emerge as Schleicher's most powerful enemy within the ''Reichswehr''.{{cn|date=January 2018}} Since [[East Prussia]] was cut off from the rest of Germany and had only one infantry division stationed there, Blomberg - to increase the number of fighting men in the event of a war with Poland - started to make lists of all the men fit for military service, which further increased the attraction of a totalitarian state able to mobilise an entire society for war to him, and of an ideologically motivated ''[[levée en masse]]'' as the best way to fight the next war.<ref name=\"Paehler 2009\"/> During his time as commander of [[Wehrkreis]] I, the military district which comprised East Prussia, Blomberg fell under the influence of a [[Nazi Party|Nazi]]-sympathising Lutheran chaplain, [[Ludwig Müller (theologian)| Ludwig Müller]], who introduced Blomberg to [[National Socialism]].{{sfn|Wheeler-Bennett|1967|p=296}} Blomberg cared little for Nazi doctrines ''per se'', his support for the Nazis being motivated by his belief that only a dictatorship could make Germany a great military power again, and that the Nazis were the best party to establish a dictatorship in Germany.{{sfn|Wheeler-Bennett|1967|pp=296-97}}\n\nBecause he had the command of only one infantry division in East Prussia, Blomberg depended very strongly on ''Grenzschutz'' to increase the number of fighting men available. This led him to co-operate closely with the [[Sturmabteilung|SA]] as a source of volunteers for ''Grenzschutz'' forces.<ref name=\"Feuchtwanger, Edgar pages 252–253\">Feuchtwanger, Edgar ''From Weimar to Hitler'', London: Macmillan, 1993, pp. 252–53.</ref> Blomberg's had excellent relations with the SA at this time, which led to the SA serving by 1931 as an unofficial militia backing up the ''Reichswehr''. Many generals saw East Prussia as an model for future Army-Nazi co-operation all over Germany.<ref name=\"Feuchtwanger, Edgar pages 252–253\"/> \n\nBlomberg's interactions with the SA in East Prussia led him to the conclusion that Nazis made for excellent soldiers, which further increased the appeal of National Socialism for him.<ref name=\"Feuchtwanger, Edgar pages 252–253\"/> But at the same time, Blomberg saw the SA only as a junior partner to the [[Reichsheer | Army]], and utterly opposed the SA's ambitions to replace the ''Reichswehr'' as Germany's main military force. Blomberg, like almost all German generals, envisioned a future Nazi-Army relationship where the Nazis would indoctrinate ordinary people with the right sort of ultra-nationalist, militarist values so that when young German men joined the ''Reichswehr'' they would be already half-converted into soldiers while at the same time making it clear that control of military matters would rest solely with the generals. In 1931, he visited the USA, where he openly proclaimed his belief in the certainty and the benefits of a Nazi government for Germany.{{sfn|Wheeler-Bennett|1967|p=297}} Blomberg's first wife Charlotte died on 11 May 1932, leaving him with two sons and three daughters.<ref>{{Cite book |author1= Barnett, Correlli|author2=Barnett, Corelli|title=Hitler's Generals|year=1989|publisher=Grove Press|isbn=0-8021-3994-9|page=131}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book|last=Schäfer|first=Kirstin A.|title=Werner von Blomberg: Hitlers erster Feldmarschall: eine Biographie|year=2006|publisher=Schöningh|language=de|isbn=3-506-71391-4|ref=harv}} P. 22.</ref>\n\nIn 1932, Blomberg served as part of the German delegation to the [[World Disarmament Conference]] in [[Geneva]] where, during his time as the German chief military delegate, he not only continued his pro-Nazi remarks to the press, but used his status as Germany's chief military delegate to communicate his views to [[Paul von Hindenburg]], whose position as [[Reichspräsident|President of Germany]] made him German Supreme Commander in Chief.{{sfn|Wheeler-Bennett|1967|p=297}} \n\nIn his reports to Hindenburg, Blomberg wrote that his arch-rival Schleicher's attempts to create the ''Wehrstaat'' had clearly failed, and that Germany needed a new approach to forming the ''Wehrstaat''.{{sfn|Müller|1987|p=28}} By late January 1933 it was clear that the Schleicher government could only stay in power by proclaiming [[martial law]] and by authorizing the ''Reichswehr'' to crush popular opposition. In doing so, the military would have to kill hundreds, if not thousands of German civilians; any régime established in this way could never expect to build the national consensus necessary to create the ''Wehrstaat''.<ref name=\"Geyer 1983, pp. 122\">Geyer, Michael \"Etudes in Political History: Reichswehr, NSDAP and the Seizure of Power\" pp. 101–23, from ''The Nazi Machtergreifung'', edited by Peter Stachura, London: Allen & Unwin, 1983, pp. 122–23.</ref> The military had decided that Hitler alone was capable of peacefully creating the national consensus that would allow the creation of the ''Wehrstaat'', and thus the military successfully brought pressure on Hindenburg to appoint Hitler as [[Reichskanzler|Chancellor]].<ref name=\"Geyer 1983, pp. 122\"/> Blomberg served as one of the main channels by which the ''Reichswehr'' informed Hindenburg of their wish to see Hitler become Chancellor.{{cn|date=January 2018}}\n\nIn late January 1933 President Hindenburg - without informing the chancellor, Schleicher, or the army commander, General [[Kurt von Hammerstein]] - recalled Blomberg from the World Disarmament Conference to return to Berlin.{{sfn|Wheeler-Bennett|1967|p=282}} Upon learning of this, Schleicher guessed correctly that the order to recall Blomberg to Berlin meant his own government was doomed.{{sfn|Wheeler-Bennett|1967|p=282}} When Blomberg arrived at the railroad station in Berlin on 28 January 1933, he was met by [[Adolf-Friedrich Kuntzen|Major von Kuntzen]] and by Major [[Oskar von Hindenburg]], adjutant and son of President Hindenburg. Kuntzen had orders from Hammerstein for Blomberg to report at once to the Defence Ministry, while Oskar von Hindenburg had orders for Blomberg to report directly to the {{ill|Reichspräsidentenpalais|de}} (presidential palace).{{sfn|Wheeler-Bennett|1967|p=284}} \n\nOver and despite Kuntzen's protests, Blomberg chose to go with Hindenburg to meet the president, who swore him in as defence minister.{{sfn|Wheeler-Bennett|1967|p=284}} This was done in a manner contrary to the Weimar constitution, under which the president could only swear in a minister after receiving the advice of the chancellor. Hindenburg had not consulted Schleicher about his wish to see Blomberg replace him as defence minister) because in late January 1933, there were wild (and untrue) rumours circulating in Berlin that Schleicher was planning to stage a ''[[putsch]]''.<ref name=Kershaw1998_422>{{cite book|last=Kershaw|first=Ian|year=1998|title=Hitler Hubris|location= New York City|publisher= Norton|ref=harv}}, pg. 422.</ref> To counter alleged plans of a ''[[putsch]]'' by Schleicher, Hindenburg wanted to remove Schleicher as defence minister as soon as possible.{{r|Kershaw1998_422}} \n\nTwo days later, on 30 January 1933, Hindenburg swore in [[Adolf Hitler]] as Chancellor, after telling him that Blomberg was to be his defence minister regardless of his wishes. Hitler for his part welcomed and accepted Blomberg. Hitler told Blomberg, much to his satisfaction, that he wanted the Army to continue to be the main military force of the ''Reich''.{{cn|date=January 2018}}\n\n===Minister of Defence===\nIn 1933, Blomberg rose to national prominence when he was appointed Minister of Defence in Hitler's government. Blomberg became one of Hitler's most devoted followers, working feverishly to expand the size and power of the army. Blomberg was made a [[colonel general]] for his services in 1933. Although Blomberg and his predecessor [[Kurt von Schleicher|Schleicher]] loathed one another, their feud was purely personal, not political, and in all essentials Blomberg and Schleicher had identical views on foreign and defence policies. Their dispute was simply over who was best qualified to carry out these policies, not over policy differences.{{sfn|Müller|1987|p=30}}\n\nBlomberg was chosen personally by President Hindenburg as a man he trusted to safeguard the interests of the Defence Ministry, and as a man who could be expected to work well with Hitler.{{sfn|Müller|1987|p=30}} Above all, Hindenburg saw Blomberg as a man who would safeguard the German military's traditional \"state within the state\" status dating back to Prussian times, under which the military did not take orders from the civilian government headed by the chancellor, but rather co-existed as an equal alongside the civilian government, owing its allegiance only to the head of state (not the chancellor, who was the head of the government).{{sfn|Müller|1987|p=30}} \n\nUntil 1918, the head of state had been the Emperor, and since 1925 had been President Hindenburg himself.{{sfn|Müller|1987|p=30}} Defending the military \"state within the state\" while trying to reconcile the military to the Nazi system was to be one of Blomberg's major concerns as a defence minister.{{sfn|Müller|1987|p=30}}\n\nBlomberg's first act as defence minister was to carry out a purge of the officers associated with his hated arch-enemy Schleicher.{{sfn|Wheeler-Bennett|1967|p=297}} Blomberg sacked [[Ferdinand von Bredow]] as chief of the ''Ministeramt'' and replaced him with General [[Walter von Reichenau]], [[Eugen Ott (ambassador)|Eugen Ott]] was dismissed as chief of the ''Wehramt'' and sent to [[Japan]] as [[military attaché]], and General [[Wilhelm Adam (general)|Wilhelm Adam]] was sacked as chief of the ''[[Truppenamt]]'' (the disguised General Staff) and replaced with [[Ludwig Beck]].{{sfn|Wheeler-Bennett|1967|pp=298-99}} \n\nBritish historian [[John Wheeler-Bennett|Sir John Wheeler-Bennett]] wrote about the \"ruthless\" way that Blomberg set about isolating and undermining the power of the army commander-in-chief, a close associate of Schleicher's, General [[Kurt von Hammerstein-Equord]], to the point that in February 1934 Hammerstein finally resigned in despair, as his powers had become more nominal than real.{{sfn|Wheeler-Bennett|1967|p=300}} With Hammerstein's resignation, the entire Schleicher faction which had dominated the army since 1926 had all been removed from their positions within the High Command. Wheeler-Bennett commented that as a military politician Blomberg was every bit as ruthless as Schleicher had been.{{sfn|Wheeler-Bennett|1967|p=300}}\n\nFar more serious than dealing with the followers of Schleicher was Blomberg's relations with the SA. Blomberg was an ardent supporter of the National Socialist dictatorship, but he was resolutely opposed to any effort to subject the military to the control of the Nazi Party or that of any of its affiliated organisations such as the SA or the SS, and throughout his time as a minister he fought fiercely to protect the institutional autonomy of the military.{{sfn|Wheeler-Bennett|1967|pp=308-09}} \n\nBy the autumn of 1933, Blomberg had come into conflict with [[Ernst Röhm]] who made it clear that he wanted to see the SA absorb the ''Reichswehr'', a prospect that Blomberg was determined to prevent at all costs. In December 1933, he made clear to Hitler his displeasure about Röhm being appointed to the Cabinet.{{sfn|Wheeler-Bennett|1967|pp=308-09}} \n\nIn February 1934, when Röhm penned a memo about the SA absorbing the ''Reichswehr'' to become the new military force, Blomberg informed Hitler the Army would never accept this under any conditions. Beginning March 1934, Blomberg and Röhm openly fought each other at cabinet meetings, exchanging insults and threats.{{sfn|Wheeler-Bennett|1967|pp=301-11}} As a result of his increasingly heated feud with Röhm, Blomberg warned Hitler that he must curb the ambitions of the SA, or the Army would do that job themselves.{{sfn|Wheeler-Bennett|1967|p=312}}\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 183-1988-0106-501, von Blomberg. 40-jähriges Militärjubiläum.jpg|thumb|260px|War minister and OKW commander Werner von Blomberg followed by the three armed forces chiefs inspects a parade in honor of his 1937 birthday.|alt=Werner von Blomberg inspects a parade in his honor on his birthday. Soldiers with Guns stand to attention.]]\nTo defend the military \"state within the state\", Blomberg followed a strategy of Nazifying the military more and more in a paradoxical effort to persuade Hitler that it was not necessary to end the traditional \"state within the state\", to prevent ''[[Gleichschaltung]]'' being imposed by engaging in what can be called a process of \"self-Gleichschaltung\".<ref>Bartov, Omer, \"Soldiers, Nazis and War in the Third Reich\", pp. 129–150 from ''The Third Reich: The Essential Readings'' edited by Christian Leitz, London: Blackwell, 1999, p. 143.</ref> \n\nIn February 1934, Blomberg, on his own initiative, had all of the men considered to be Jews serving in the ''Reichswehr'' given an automatic and immediate [[dishonorable discharge]].<ref name=\"Förster1998_268\">{{cite book|last=Förster|first=Jürgen|authorlink=Jürgen Förster|chapter=Complicity or Entanglement?

As a result, seven officers, eight officer cadets, thirteen NCOs and 28 privates from the Army, and three officers, four officer candidates, three NCOs and four sailors from the Navy were dishonourably discharged, together with four civilian employees of the Defence Ministry.{{sfn|Wette|2006|pp=71-72}} \n\nWith the exception of [[Erich von Manstein]], who complained that Blomberg had ruined the careers of some seventy men for something that was not their fault, there were no objections.{{sfn|Wette|2006|p=73}} Again, on his own initiative as part of \"self-Gleichschaltung\", Blomberg had the ''Reichswehr'' in May 1934 adopt Nazi symbols into their uniforms.{{sfn|Wheeler-Bennett|1967|p=312}} In 1935, Blomberg worked hard to ensure that the Wehrmacht complied with the [[Nuremberg Laws]] by preventing so-called ''[[Mischling]]s'' from serving.{{sfn|Förster|1998|pp=268-69}}\n\nBlomberg had a reputation as something of a lackey to Hitler. As such, he was nicknamed \"Rubber Lion\" by some of his critics in the army who were less than enthusiastic about Hitler. One of the few notable exceptions was during the run-up to the [[Night of the Long Knives]], June 30–July 2, 1934.{{cn|date=January 2018}} In early June, Hindenburg decided that unless Hitler did something to end the growing political tension in Germany, he would declare martial law and turn over control of the government to the army. Blomberg, who had been known to oppose the growing power of the [[Sturmabteilung|SA]], was chosen to inform Hitler of this decision on the president's behalf.{{cn|date=January 2018}}\n\nIn the same year, after Hindenburg's death on August 2, as part of his \"self-Gleichschaltung\" strategy, Blomberg personally ordered all soldiers in the army and all sailors in the Navy to pledge the ''[[Reichswehreid]]'' (oath of allegiance) not to ''People and Fatherland'', but to the new ''Führer'' Adolf Hitler, which is thought to have limited later opposition to Hitler. The oath was the initiative of Blomberg and that of the ''Ministeramt'' chief General [[Walther von Reichenau]], the entire military took an [[Hitler oath|oath of personal loyalty]] to Hitler, who was most surprised at the offer; the popular view that Hitler imposed the oath on the military is incorrect.{{sfn|Kershaw|1998|p=525}} \n\nThe intention of Blomberg and Reichenau in having the military swear an oath to Hitler was to create a personal special bond between Hitler and the military, which was intended to tie Hitler more tightly towards the military and away from the [[Nazi Party]] (Blomberg later admitted that he did not think through the full implications of the oath at the time).{{sfn|Kershaw|1998|p=525}} As part of his defence of the military \"state within the state\", Blomberg fought against the attempts of the SS to create a military wing.{{sfn|Wheeler-Bennett|p=341}} \n\nThe ''Reichsführer'' SS [[Heinrich Himmler]] repeatedly insisted that the SS needed a military wing to crush any attempt at a Communist revolution before Blomberg conceded that the SS could form a military one, which eventually become the Waffen-SS.{{sfn|Wheeler-Bennett|p=341}} \n\nBlomberg's relations with the SS were badly strained in late 1934-early 1935 when it was discovered that the SS had bugged the offices of the ''Abwehr'' chief, Admiral Wilhelm Canaris, which led Blomberg to warn Hitler the military would not tolerate being spied upon. In response to Blomberg's protests, Hitler gave orders that the SS could not spy upon the military; all members of the military could not be arrested by the police; and cases of suspected \"political unreliability\" within the military were to be investigated solely by the military police.{{sfn|Wheeler-Bennett|pp=341-42}}\n\n==Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces and Minister of War==\nIn 1935, the Ministry of Defence was renamed the Ministry of War; Blomberg also took the title of commander-in-chief of the armed forces. In 1936, the loyal Blomberg was the first [[Field Marshal (Germany)|''Generalfeldmarschall'']] appointed by Hitler. He was also the Commander in Chief of the Armed Forces, the [[Wehrmacht]], although Hitler was the Supreme Commander of the military due to his dictatorial position as the Führer of Germany.{{cn|date=January 2018}} \n\nIn December 1936, a crisis was created within the German decision-making machinery when General [[Wilhelm Faupel]], the chief German officer in Spain started to demand the dispatch of three German divisions to fight in the [[Spanish Civil War]] as the only way for victory, a demand strongly opposed by the Foreign Minister Baron [[Konstantin von Neurath]], who wanted to limit German involvement in Spain.<ref>{{cite book|last=Weinberg|first=Gerhard|year=1970|title=The Foreign Policy of Hitler's Germany: Diplomatic Revolution in Europe|publisher=University of Chicago Press|isbn=978-039103825-7|ref=harv}} pp. 296–97.</ref> \n\nAt a conference held at the ''Reich'' Chancellery on 21 December 1936 attended by Hitler, [[Hermann Göring]], Blomberg, Neurath, General [[Werner von Fritsch]], General [[Walter Warlimont]] and Faupel, Blomberg argued against Faupel, arguing that an all-out German drive for victory in Spain would be too likely to cause a general war before Germany had rearmed properly, and if even it did not, would consume money better spent on military modernization. Blomberg prevailed against Faupel.{{sfn|Weinberg|1970|pp=297-98}}\n\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 183-C10332, Bayreuth, Festspiele, Joseph Goebbels, Werner v. Blomberg.jpg|thumb|Blomberg with [[Joseph Goebbels]], 1937]]\nUnfortunately for Blomberg, his position as the ranking officer of the Third ''Reich'' alienated [[Hermann Göring]], Hitler's second-in-command, and Commander-in-Chief of the [[Luftwaffe]], Germany's air force and [[Heinrich Himmler]], the Chief of the SS, the security organization of the [[NSDAP]], and concurrently the chief of all police forces of Germany, who conspired to oust him from power. Göring, in particular, had ambitions of becoming Commander-in-Chief himself of the entire military.{{cn|date=January 2018}}\n\nOn 5 November 1937, the conference between the ''Reich'''s top military-foreign policy leadership and Hitler recorded in the so-called [[Hossbach Memorandum]] occurred. At the conference, Hitler stated that it was the time for war, or, more accurately, wars, as what Hitler envisioned were a series of localised wars in [[Central Europe|Central]] and [[Eastern Europe]] in the near future. Hitler argued that because these wars were necessary to provide Germany with ''[[Lebensraum]]'', [[autarky]] and the [[arms race]] with [[France]] and [[UK|Britain]] made it imperative to act before the Western powers developed an insurmountable lead in the arms race.<ref>[[Manfred Messerschmidt|Messerschmidt, Manfred]] \"Foreign Policy and Preparation for War\" from ''[[Germany and the Second World War]]'' Volume I, Clarendon Press: Oxford, Oxfordshire, United Kingdom, 1990, pp. 636–37.<!-- ISSN/ISBN needed --></ref><ref>Carr, William ''Arms, Autarky and Aggression'' Edward Arnold: London, United Kingdom, 1972, pp. 73–78.<!-- ISSN/ISBN needed --></ref>\n\nOf those invited to the conference, objections arose from the Foreign Minister [[Konstantin von Neurath]], Blomberg and the Army Commander in Chief, General [[Werner von Fritsch]] that any German aggression in Eastern Europe was bound to trigger a war with France because of the French alliance system in Eastern Europe, the so-called ''[[cordon sanitaire]]'', and if a Franco-German war broke out, then Britain was almost certain to intervene rather than risk the prospect of France's defeat. Moreover, it was objected that Hitler's assumption that Britain and France would just ignore the projected wars because they had started their re-armament later than Germany was flawed.{{sfn|Weinberg|1970|pp=39-40}}\n\nAccordingly, Fritsch, Blomberg and Neurath advised Hitler to wait until Germany had more time to re-arm before pursuing a high-risk strategy of localised wars that was likely to trigger a general war before Germany was ready (none of those present at the conference had any moral objections to Hitler's strategy, with which they were in basic agreement; only the question of timing divided them).{{sfn|Weinberg|1970|p=342}} \n\nFollowing the [[Hossbach Memorandum]] meeting of November 1937, Blomberg was one of the few who criticised Hitler's plans to go to war no later than 1942, much to Hitler's displeasure, though by early 1938 he changed his mind on this issue.{{cn|date=January 2018}}\n\n==Scandal and fall==\nGöring and Himmler found an opportunity to strike against Blomberg in January 1938, when the general, then 59, married his second wife, Erna Gruhn (1913–1978, sometimes referred to as \"Eva\" or \"Margarete\"). Blomberg had been a widower since the death of his first wife Charlotte in 1932.<ref name=\"Biographical companion\">{{Cite book|last=Nicholls|first=David|year=2000|title=Adolf Hitler: a biographical companion|publisher=ABC-CLIO|location=Santa Barbara, CA|isbn=0-87436-965-7|p=29}}</ref> Gruhn was a 26-year-old typist and secretary, but the Berlin police had a long criminal file on her and her mother, a former prostitute. Among the reports was information that in 1932, Erna Gruhn had posed for pornographic photos.<ref name=\"Background of Erna Gruhn\">{{Cite book|last=Glasman|first=Gabriel|title=Objetivo: Cazar al Lobo|year=2005|publisher=Ediciones Nowtilus, S.L.|location=Madrid, Spain|isbn=970-732-177-6|pages=120-21}}</ref>\n\nThis was reported to the Berlin police chief Count [[Wolf-Heinrich Graf von Helldorf|Wolf-Heinrich von Helldorf]] who went to [[Wilhelm Keitel]] with the file on the new Mrs. Blomberg, saying he was uncertain about what to do. Keitel in his turn, seeing a chance to destroy Blomberg's career, told Helldorf to take the file to Göring, which he did.{{sfn|Wheeler-Bennett|1967|p=366}} \n\nGöring, who had served as best man to Blomberg at the wedding, used the file to argue Blomberg was unfit to serve as a war minister.{{sfn|Faber|2008|pp=46-75}} Göring then informed Hitler, who had been present at the wedding. Hitler ordered Blomberg to annul the marriage to avoid a scandal and to preserve the integrity of the army. The upcoming wedding of one of Blomberg's daughters, Dorothea, would have been threatened by scandal. She was engaged to [[Karl-Heinz Keitel]], eldest son of [[Wilhelm Keitel]]. Blomberg refused to end his marriage but, but when Göring threatened to make her public the pasts of Erna Gruhn and her mother, Blomberg was forced to resign his posts to avoid this, which he did on 27 January 1938. His daughter was married in May the same year.<ref>{{Cite book|author1=Wilhelm Keitel|author2=Walter Görlitz|year=1966|title=The memoirs of Field-Marshal Keitel|publisher=Stein and Day|pp=41, 77}}</ref>\n\nAs a consequence, Hitler took personal command of the military; he retained the title of Supreme Commander, abolished the Ministry of War and in its place, created the High Command of the Armed Forces ([[OKW]]) under his control, to be the supervisory body of the Wehrmacht (armed forces).{{cn|date=January 2018}} Keitel, who would be promoted to the rank of [[Field Marshal]] in 1940, and Blomberg's former right-hand man would be appointed by Hitler as the Chief of the OKW of the Armed Forces. Keitel thus became the de facto Minister of War.{{cn|date=January 2018}}\n\nA few days later, Göring and Himmler accused Commander-in-Chief of the Army [[Werner von Fritsch]] of being a homosexual. Hitler used these opportunities for major reorganization of the ''[[Wehrmacht]]''. Fritsch was later acquitted; together the events became known as the [[Blomberg-Fritsch Affair]].\n\nBlomberg and his wife subsequently went on a honeymoon for a year to the isle of [[Capri]]. Admiral [[Erich Raeder]] decided that Blomberg needed to commit suicide in order to atone for his marriage, and dispatched a Captain von Wangenheim to Italy, who followed the Blombergs around on their honeymoon, persistently and unsuccessfully trying to force Blomberg to commit suicide.{{sfn|Wheeler-Bennett|1967|p=368}} Von Wangenheim at one point even tried to force a gun into Blomberg's hands; but he declined to end his life.<ref>Shirer, William ''The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich'', New York: Simon & Schuster, 1960, p. 314.</ref> Spending [[World War II]] in obscurity, Blomberg was captured by the [[Allies of World War II|Allies]] in 1945. Later he gave evidence at the [[Nuremberg Trials]].\n\n==Imprisonment and death==\nBlomberg's health declined rapidly while he was in detention at [[Nuremberg]], facing the contempt of his former colleagues and the intention of his wife to abandon him. It is possible that he manifested symptoms of cancer as early as 1939. On 12 October 1945 he noted in his diary that he weighed slightly over 72 kilograms. Diagnosed with [[colorectal cancer]] on 20 February 1946, he spent the final weeks of his life resigned and in depression, refusing to eat.{{sfn|Schäfer|2006|pp=200, 206-07}} \n\nBlomberg died on 14 March 1946, and was buried without ceremony in an [[unmarked grave]].

When a member of the House of Representatives resigns, he or she would normally tender the resignation to the Speaker. The Speaker has a discretion as to when to call a by-election and may not call one at all, for example, if a general election is imminent. At least 33 days must elapse between the issue by the Speaker of a writ and the date of a by-election, and the Speaker cannot issue the writ until receipt of a formal letter of resignation. A by-election must take place on a Saturday.\n__NOTOC__\n==List of by-elections==\nIn the following table, gains for the [[Australian Labor Party]] are highlighted in red, for the [[Liberal Party of Australia]] and its predecessors (including the [[Protectionist Party]]) in blue, for the [[National Party of Australia]] and its predecessors as well as the unrelated [[Australian Greens]] in green<!-- The National's little colour block is green too in this article, and I think it makes it confusing. I would change it to a different shade of blue if I had any idea how to-->, and for others in grey.\n\nBrackets around a date indicate that the candidate was unopposed when nominations closed. These candidates were declared \"elected unopposed\" with effect from the date of the closing of nominations, and there was no need to hold a by-election.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n|colspan=\"9\" |\n===45th Parliament (2016–present)===\n|- \n|- \n!Division !!

He participated in 75 Grands Prix, debuting on September 7, 1986. In 2006 he raced in the inaugural season of the [[Grand Prix Masters]] formula for retired Formula One drivers.\n\n==Early life==\nCaffi was born in [[Rovato]] ([[province of Brescia]]), in [[Northern Italy]]. He spent three years in Italian [[Formula Three]] from 1984 to 1986, finishing runner-up in 1984 and 1985, then third in 1986. 1986 also saw him land a one-off drive with the [[Osella]] [[Formula One]] team.\n\n==Formula One career==\n===1980s===\n;1986\nCaffi was handed his Formula One debut by [[Osella]], at his, and the team's home race, the [[1986 Italian Grand Prix|Italian Grand Prix]], in place of Canadian [[Allen Berg]]. Qualifying 27th and last in his [[Osella FA1H|FA1H]] (because of a quirk where for this race, and the following one in [[1986 Portuguese Grand Prix|Portugal]], 27 cars were allowed to start) Caffi drove sensibly and steadily to stay out of trouble and come home last of the runners, albeit six laps down and unclassified.\n\n;1987\nOsella were impressed by his sensible approach, and signed him for a full season in [[1987 Formula One season|1987]]. The [[Alfa Romeo (Formula One)|Alfa Romeo]] powered [[Osella FA1I|FA1I]] was uncompetitive and unreliable; Caffi finished no races out of 16 and failed to qualify twice, though he was classified once. At the opening round, the [[1987 Brazilian Grand Prix|Brazilian Grand Prix]], Caffi retired after 21 laps due to exhaustion as the heat and physically demanding nature of the car proved too much.\n\nThe [[1987 San Marino Grand Prix|San Marino Grand Prix]], three weeks later, provided Caffi with his only classification of the year, 12th, despite running out of fuel five laps from the finish. Then came a run of 10 consecutive retirements; in [[1987 Belgian Grand Prix|Belgium]], [[1987 Monaco Grand Prix|Monaco]], where he qualified an excellent 16th and ran as high as 10th, the [[1987 Detroit Grand Prix|United States]], where he qualified 19th, [[1987 French Grand Prix|France]], [[1987 British Grand Prix|Great Britain]], [[1987 German Grand Prix|Germany]], [[1987 Hungarian Grand Prix|Hungary]], [[1987 Austrian Grand Prix|Austria]], [[1987 Italian Grand Prix|Italy]] and [[1987 Portuguese Grand Prix|Portugal]].\n\nAs the season drew to a close, Caffi failed to qualify for two of the final four races in [[1987 Spanish Grand Prix|Spain]] and [[1987 Australian Grand Prix|Australia]], bookending retirements in [[1987 Mexican Grand Prix|Mexico]], where he ran as high as 7th due to attrition, and [[1987 Japanese Grand Prix|Japan]] where he ran out of fuel. Despite finishing so few races, none were down to driver error, though Caffi was unclassified in the Drivers' Championship.\n\n;1988\n[[1988 Formula One season|1988]] saw Caffi switch to the new [[Scuderia Italia]] team. Early season form was thin. Their challenger for the season, the Dallara built and Ford-Cosworth powered [[Dallara F188|F188]] wasn't ready for the first race in [[1988 Brazilian Grand Prix|Brazil]], so to fulfil the championship's requirements of entering every race, a modified [[Formula 3000]] car, the [[Dallara 3087|3087]], was used as a stop-gap. Not surprisingly, Caffi failed to pre-qualify.\n\nThe new car arrived in time for [[1988 San Marino Grand Prix|San Marino]], but fortunes failed to improve as Caffi retired and an excellent 17th in qualifying at [[1988 Monaco Grand Prix|Monaco]] was ruined when he crashed all alone on the opening lap, the first blot on his career copybook. Caffi's third retirement in a row in [[1988 Mexican Grand Prix|Mexico]] and failure to qualify in [[1988 Canadian Grand Prix|Canada]] only added to the nightmare.\n\nMid-season though saw a turnaround in both Caffi's, and the team's season, with four finishes on the spin; 8th in the [[1988 Detroit Grand Prix|United States]], 12th in [[1988 French Grand Prix|France]] after qualifying 14th, 11th in [[1988 British Grand Prix|Great Britain]] and 15th in [[1988 German Grand Prix|Germany]] after qualifying 19th.\n\nForm during the following five races was patchy. Three top-10 finishes; 8th in [[1988 Belgian Grand Prix|Belgium]] after qualifying 15th, 7th in [[1988 Portuguese Grand Prix|Portugal]] (his best career finish at the time) after qualifying 17th and 10th in [[1988 Spanish Grand Prix|Spain]] after qualifying 18th, were scattered around a couple of retirements; in [[1988 Hungarian Grand Prix|Hungary]] where he qualified in the top-10 for the first time in 10th, and [[1988 Italian Grand Prix|Italy]].\n\n1988 concluded with a brace of retirements in [[1988 Japanese Grand Prix|Japan]], where he spun off, and after qualifying 11th in [[1988 Australian Grand Prix|Australia]]. For the second season in a row Caffi was unclassified in the Drivers' Championship.\n\n;1989\nScuderia Italia expanded to a two-car outfit for the [[1989 Formula One season|1989]] season, with fellow Italian [[Andrea De Cesaris]] in the second [[Pirelli]] shod [[Dallara F189|F189]]. As with the previous year, Caffi failed to pre-qualify for the opening round in [[1989 Brazilian Grand Prix|Brazil]], but [[1989 San Marino Grand Prix|San Marino]], next on the calendar, saw Caffi qualify 9th (his first top-10 start in Formula One) and finish just outside the points in 7th.\n\nMomentum continued onto [[1989 Monaco Grand Prix|Monaco]] with another top-10 in qualifying, 9th, followed by the first Formula One points for himself and the team with an excellent drive to 4th. 13th in [[1989 Mexican Grand Prix|Mexico]] was followed by retirement in the [[1989 United States Grand Prix|United States]], when Caffi, who qualified 6th and at one stage was running 2nd only to [[Alain Prost]], was pushed into the wall rather comically whilst trying to lap teammate Andrea de Cesaris.\n\nA second points finish of 6th in [[1989 Canadian Grand Prix|Canada]] was another highlight but Caffi's season rarely peaked after that with just two finishes in the final 10 races; 7th in [[1989 Hungarian Grand Prix|Hungary]] (after qualifying a stunning 3rd) and 9th in [[1989 Japanese Grand Prix|Japan]].\n\nFailure to finish in [[1989 French Grand Prix|France]], [[1989 German Grand Prix|Germany]], [[1989 Belgian Grand Prix|Belgium]], after spinning off, [[1989 Italian Grand Prix|Italy]], [[1989 Portuguese Grand Prix|Portugal]] where he qualified 7th then collided with three-time World Drivers' Champion [[Nelson Piquet]], [[1989 Spanish Grand Prix|Spain]] and [[1989 Australian Grand Prix|Australia]], where he qualified 10th before spinning off, along with a failure to pre-qualify in [[1989 British Grand Prix|Great Britain]] rounded off an inconsistent year. Four points and 19th in the Drivers' Championship were Caffi's rewards.\n\n===1990s===\n;1990\nCaffi, by now gaining a reputation as a promising talent, was tempted to [[Arrows Grand Prix International|Arrows]] for 1990 as Japan's Footwork Corporation were investing in the team throughout the year (to the extent that Arrows was renamed Footwork from 1991 to 1996) and [[Porsche]] had agreed to supply engines to the squad. Caffi was signed to drive the second [[Arrows A11|A11]] alongside another Italian, [[1985 Formula One season|1985]] World Drivers' Championship runner-up [[Michele Alboreto]].\n\nInjury caused by a pre-season cycling accident forced Caffi to sit out the opening race in the [[1990 United States Grand Prix|United States]], with German [[Bernd Schneider (racing driver)|Bernd Schneider]] filling the gap. Retirement in [[1990 Brazilian Grand Prix|Brazil]] and failure to qualify in [[1990 San Marino Grand Prix|San Marino]] only compounded Caffi's woes.\n\nThe following four races were patchy with a 5th, and two points, in [[1990 Monaco Grand Prix|Monaco]] followed by an 8th in [[1990 Canadian Grand Prix|Canada]], failure to qualify in [[1990 Mexican Grand Prix|Mexico]] and retirement in [[1990 French Grand Prix|France]]. Five consecutive top-10 finishes mid-season; in [[1990 British Grand Prix|Great Britain]], [[1990 German Grand Prix|Germany]], [[1990 Hungarian Grand Prix|Hungary]], [[1990 Belgian Grand Prix|Belgium]] and [[1990 Italian Grand Prix|Italy]] brought about a consistency to Caffi's performance.\n\nHis, and everybody's, [[1990 Portuguese Grand Prix|Portuguese Grand Prix]] was ended early when he crashed into the [[Lola Cars|Lola]] of [[Aguri Suzuki]] and the resulting foot injuries ruled Caffi out of the next race, [[1990 Spanish Grand Prix|Spain]], with Schneider once again deputising.\n\nAnother positive performance of 9th in [[1990 Japanese Grand Prix|Japan]] was cancelled out by failure to qualify for the final round in [[1990 Australian Grand Prix|Australia]]. Over the course of the season Caffi scored all the team's points and outperformed the more experienced Alboreto to end 1990 with two points and 16th in the Drivers' Championship.\n\n;1991\nAs Caffi's career gradually rose in stock throughout the previous year, [[1991 Formula One season|1991]] looked promising for the Italian. Unfortunately, the season turned out to be anything but. The [[Porsche 3512]] [[V12 engine|V12]] was cumbersome and underpowered, whilst both cars, the [[Footwork A11C|A11C]] and the [[Footwork FA12|FA12]] were little better.\n\nFor the first time in his Formula One career, Caffi failed to qualify for any of the opening four races; in the [[1991 United States Grand Prix|United States]], [[1991 Brazilian Grand Prix|Brazil]], [[1991 San Marino Grand Prix|San Marino]], and [[1991 Monaco Grand Prix|Monaco]].\n\nThe latter would be best remembered for a huge crash in practice, when Caffi slid off line and into the barriers at the Swimming Pool series of corners. The impact was so heavy, the car broke in three; the gearbox and rear wing broke free from the engine, which in turn came clear of the tub. Despite suffering no serious injuries as a result of the crash, Caffi was injured shortly after in a road accident.\n\nAs a result, Footwork drafted in [[Stefan Johansson]] for the races in [[1991 Canadian Grand Prix|Canada]], [[1991 Mexican Grand Prix|Mexico]], [[1991 French Grand Prix|France]] and [[1991 British Grand Prix|Great Britain]] and when Caffi returned to fitness, he discovered the team were trying to keep the Swede on. He managed to regain his seat via a legal injunction, but the struggles re-commenced with failure to qualify in [[1991 Belgian Grand Prix|Belgium]] compounded by pre-qualification failures in [[1991 German Grand Prix|Germany]], [[1991 Hungarian Grand Prix|Hungary]], [[1991 Italian Grand Prix|Italy]], [[1991 Portuguese Grand Prix|Portugal]] and [[1991 Spanish Grand Prix|Spain]].\n\nThe season ended on a slightly higher note, as Caffi finished 10th in [[1991 Japanese Grand Prix|Japan]] and kept his head above water to finish 15th in the deluge in [[1991 Australian Grand Prix|Australia]]. A season of catastrophe yielded no points and no classification in the Drivers' Championship.\n\n;1992\nFootwork signed Aguri Suzuki to partner Michele Alboreto ahead of the [[1992 Formula One season|1992]] season and Caffi was, rather abruptly, shown the door. With little time to find a drive, and most seats taken, he had no option but to sign for the new [[Andrea Moda Formula|Andrea Moda]] team, alongside Italian [[Enrico Bertaggia]]. The team, owned by shoe-magnate and playboy [[Andrea Sassetti]], had bought out the [[Scuderia Coloni|Coloni]] squad in 1991 and planned to use their [[Coloni C4|C4]] chassis with [[Judd (engine)|Judd V10]] power for the new season.\n\nHowever, registration problems with the FIA (involving Sassetti's refusal to pay the $100,000 entrance fee for new teams) meant that Caffi managed no more than a few exploratory laps at the [[1992 South African Grand Prix|South African Grand Prix]], the opening round of 1992. Before the next round in [[1992 Mexican Grand Prix|Mexico]], the team's new car, the [[Nick Wirth]]-designed [[Andrea Moda S921|S921]], was built and prepared but freight delays forced Sassetti to withdraw both Caffi and Bertaggia from the Mexican event.\n\nAfter two races Caffi had had enough, voiced his displeasure of the situation and was fired by Sassetti, with Brazilian super-sub [[Roberto Moreno]] taking his seat. No points from both races meant no classification in the Drivers' Championship, but more significantly, it signalled the end of the Italian's Formula One career at the age of 28.\n\n==Later life==\nAfter F1 he raced on and off in sports and touring cars, mainly in the United States, where in 1998 he had an IRL test at Pikes Peak Raceway. After a brief career in Spanish and Italian [[Touring Cars]], Caffi found his niche in sportscars, racing in GTs, [[FIA Sportscar Championship|FIA Sportscar]], and [[American Le Mans Series|ALMS]]. He returned to International motorsport in the IRC Rally Monte-Carlo 2011, driving a Skoda Fabia S2000. 25 years after his Formula 1 career Italian Alex Caffi  won on the streets of the Principality during the Monaco Grand Prix Historique 2016. Caffi was one of the high-profile winners during the 10th running of the GP Historique when he guided the Kessel Racing Ensign N176 to victory in the Pre 1977 3-litre F1 race.\n\nWhen he is not racing he is an instructor at the official Subaru Italia safety driving and racing school.\n\n==Racing record==\n\n===Complete Formula One results===\n([[:Template:F1 driver results legend 2|key]])\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center; font-size:90%\"\n!

    "title": "History of Poland (1939–1945)",
    "text": "{{History of Poland}}\n\nThe '''history of Poland from 1939 to 1945''' encompasses primarily the period from the [[Invasion of Poland]] by [[Nazi Germany]] to the end of [[World War II]]. Following the [[Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact|German-Soviet non-aggression pact]], [[Poland]] was invaded by Nazi Germany on 1 September 1939 and by the [[Soviet Union]] [[Soviet invasion of Poland|on 17 September]]. The campaigns ended in early October with [[Germany]] and the Soviet Union [[German–Soviet Treaty of Friendship, Cooperation and Demarcation|dividing and annexing the whole of Poland]]. After the [[Operation Barbarossa|Axis attack on the Soviet Union]] in the summer of 1941, all of [[Second Polish Republic|Poland]] was occupied by Germany. Under the two occupations, Polish citizens suffered enormous human and material losses. It is estimated that about 5.7 million Polish citizens died as a result of the German occupation and about 150,000 Polish citizens died as a result of the Soviet occupation. Ethnic Poles were subjected to both the Nazi and Soviet persecution. The Jews were singled out by the Germans for a quick and total annihilation and about 90% of [[History of the Jews in Poland|Polish Jews]] (close to three million people) [[the Holocaust|were murdered]]. Jews and others were killed ''en masse'' at Nazi [[extermination camp]]s, such as [[Auschwitz concentration camp|Auschwitz]], [[Treblinka extermination camp|Treblinka]] and [[Sobibór extermination camp|Sobibór]]. [[Ethnic cleansing]] and [[Massacres of Poles in Volhynia and Eastern Galicia|massacres of civilian populations]], mostly Poles, were perpetrated in western [[Ukraine]] from 1943.\n\nIn September 1939, the Polish government officials sought refuge in [[Romania]], but their subsequent internment there prevented the intended continuation abroad as the government of Poland. General [[Władysław Sikorski]], a former prime minister, arrived in [[France]], where a replacement [[Polish Government-in-Exile]] was soon formed. After the [[Battle of France|fall of France]] the Polish government was evacuated to [[United Kingdom|Britain]]. The [[Polish Armed Forces in the West|Polish armed forces]] had been reconstituted and fought alongside the [[Allies of World War II|Western Allies]] in France, Britain and elsewhere. A [[Polish resistance movement in World War II|Polish resistance movement]] began organizing soon after the invasions in 1939. Its [[Union of Armed Struggle|largest military component]] was a part of the [[Polish Underground State]] network of organizations and activities and became known as the [[Home Army]]. The whole clandestine structure was formally directed by the Polish Government-in-Exile through its [[Government Delegation for Poland|delegation]] resident in Poland. There were also [[Bataliony Chłopskie|peasant]], [[National Armed Forces|right-wing]], [[Armia Ludowa|leftist]] and [[Jewish Combat Organization|Jewish]] partisan organizations. Among the failed anti-German uprisings were the [[Warsaw Ghetto Uprising]] and the [[Warsaw Uprising]]. The Warsaw Uprising was intended to prevent a Soviet domination of the government of Poland.\n\nIn order to cooperate with the Soviet Union, after [[Operation Barbarossa]] an important war ally of the West, Sikorski negotiated in [[Moscow]] with [[Joseph Stalin]] and the [[Sikorski–Mayski agreement|formation of a Polish army in the Soviet Union was agreed]], intended to fight on the [[Eastern Front (World War II)|Eastern Front]] alongside the Soviets. The \"[[Anders' Army]]\" was instead taken to the [[Middle East]] and then to [[Italy]]. Further efforts to continue the Polish-Soviet cooperation had failed because of disagreements over the borders, the discovery of the [[Katyn massacre]] of Polish [[Prisoner of war|POW]]s perpetrated by the Soviets, and the [[1943 Gibraltar B-24 crash|death of General Sikorski]]. Afterwards, in a process seen by many Poles as a [[Western betrayal]], the Polish Government-in-Exile gradually ceased being a recognized partner in the [[Allies of World War II|Allied coalition]].\n\nStalin pursued a strategy of facilitating the formation of a Polish government independent of (and in opposition to) the exile government in [[London]] by empowering the [[communism in Poland|Polish communists]]. Among Polish communist organizations established during the war were the [[Polish Workers' Party]] in occupied Poland and the [[Union of Polish Patriots]] in Moscow. A new [[Polish Army in the East#Berling Army: 1943-1945|Polish army]] was formed in the Soviet Union to fight together with the Soviets. At the same time Stalin worked on co-opting the Western Allies (the [[United States]] led by President [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] and the [[United Kingdom]] led by Prime Minister [[Winston Churchill]]), who, in terms of practical implementations, conformed to Stalin's views on Poland's borders and future government. The fate of Poland had been determined in a series of negotiations that included the conferences in [[Tehran Conference|Tehran]], [[Yalta Conference|Yalta]], and [[Potsdam Conference|Potsdam]]. In 1944, the Polish Government-in-Exile approved and the underground in Poland undertook unilateral [[Council of National Unity|political]] and [[Operation Tempest|military actions]] aimed at establishing an independent Polish authority, but they were not successful. The Polish communists founded the [[State National Council]] in 1943/44 in occupied [[Warsaw]] and the [[Polish Committee of National Liberation]] in July 1944 in [[Lublin]], after the arrival of the [[Red Army|Soviet army]]. The Soviet Union kept the prewar Polish eastern lands ([[Kresy]]), granting Poland instead the greater southern portion of the eliminated German [[East Prussia]] and shifting the country west to the [[Oder–Neisse line]], at the expense of Germany.\n\n==Before the war==\n\n===Rearmament and first annexations===\n\nAfter the death of [[Józef Piłsudski]] in 1935, the [[Sanation]] government of [[Piłsudski's colonels|his political followers]], along with President [[Ignacy Mościcki]], embarked on a military reform and rearmament of the Polish Army in the face of the changing political climate in Europe. Thanks in part to a financial loan from France, Poland's new [[Central Industrial Region (Poland)|Central Industrial Region]] participated in the project from 1936 in an attempt to catch-up with the advanced weapons development by Poland's richer neighbors. Foreign Minister [[Józef Beck]] continued to resist the growing pressure on Poland from the West to cooperate with the Soviet Union in order to contain Germany.<ref name=\"Davies Europe 978\"/><ref name=\"Czubiński historia Polski 153-156\"/><ref name=\"Czubiński historia Polski 156-159\"/> Against the rapidly growing German military force, Poland not only possessed no comparable quantity of technical resources, but also lacked the knowledge and concepts of developing modern warfare.<ref name=\"Czubiński historia Polski 163-167\"/>\n\nThe officially pursued German rearmament began in 1935 under [[Adolf Hitler]], contrary to the provisions of the [[Treaty of Versailles]] {{ndash}} the foundation of the post-[[World War I]] international order. Unable to prevent Hitler's [[remilitarization of the Rhineland]], the United Kingdom and France also pursued rearmament. Meanwhile, the German territorial expansion into central Europe began in earnest with the ''[[Anschluss]]'' of [[Austria]] in March 1938. Poland dispatched special diversionary groups to the [[Teschen conflict|disputed Zaolzie]] ([[Czech lands|Czech]] [[Silesia]]) area in hope of expediting the breakup of [[Czechoslovakia]] and regaining the territory. The [[Munich Agreement]] of 30 September 1938 was followed by Germany's incorporation of the [[Sudetenland]]. Faced with the threat of a total annexation of Czechoslovakia, the Western Powers endorsed the German partition of the country.<ref name=\"Overy 294-295\"/><ref name=\"Brzoza Sowa Historia Polski 1918–1945 483–490\"/>\n\nPoland insistently sought a great power status, but was not invited to participate in the Munich conference. Minister Beck, disappointed with the lack of recognition, issued an ultimatum on the day of the Munich Agreement to the government of Czechoslovakia, demanding an immediate return to Poland of the contested Zaolzie border region. The distressed Czechoslovak government complied, and Polish military units [[Polish–Czechoslovak border conflicts|took over the area]]. The move was negatively received in the West and contributed to the worsening of the geopolitical situation of Poland. In November, the Polish government also annexed a small border region in dispute with the newly autonomous state of [[Slovakia]] and gave its support to [[Hungary]]'s expansion into [[Carpatho-Ukraine]], located within the now federal Czechoslovakia.<ref name=\"Brzoza Sowa Historia Polski 1918–1945 483–490\"/><ref name=\"Zgórniak 409\"/><ref name=\"Zgórniak 410-412\"/>\n\n===Aftermath of the Munich Agreement===\n\nThe Munich Agreement of 1938 did not last for long. In March 1939 the [[German occupation of Czechoslovakia]] began with the invasion of [[Bohemia]] and [[Moravia]], leaving Slovakia as a German puppet state. [[Lithuania]] was [[1939 German ultimatum to Lithuania|forced to give up]] its [[Klaipėda Region]] (''Memelland''). Formal demands were made for the return of the [[Free City of Danzig]] to Germany, even though its status was guaranteed by the [[League of Nations]]. In early 1939 Hitler proposed Poland an alliance on German terms, with an expectation of compliance. The Polish government would have to agree to Danzig's incorporation by [[Nazi Germany|the Reich]] and to an extraterritorial highway passage connecting [[East Prussia]] with the rest of Germany through the so-called [[Polish Corridor]] (an area linking the Polish mainland with the [[Baltic Sea]]). Poland would join an [[Anti-Comintern Pact|anti-Soviet alliance]] and coordinate its foreign policy with Germany, thus becoming a client state. The independence-minded Polish government was alarmed and a British guarantee of Poland's independence was issued on 31 March 1939. Reacting to this act and to Poland's effective rejection of the German demands, Hitler renounced the existing [[German–Polish Non-Aggression Pact]] on April 28.<ref name=\"Czubiński historia Polski 156-159\"/><ref name=\"Davies Europe 991-998\"/>\n\n[[File:MolotovRibbentropStalin.jpg|250px|right|thumb|Soviet Prime Minister [[Vyacheslav Molotov]] signs the [[Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact]]. Behind him stand (left) Foreign Minister [[Joachim von Ribbentrop]] of Germany and (right) [[Joseph Stalin]]. The Pact effectively created a Nazi-Soviet alliance and arrangements for a partition of Poland's territory were made.]]\n\nIn August 1939 negotiations took place in Moscow, launched by the competing Allied-Soviet and Nazi-Soviet working groups, each attempting to enlist Stalin's powerful army on their side. By the evening of 23 August 1939, Germany's offer was accepted by default, because the Polish leaders' refusal to cooperate militarily with the Soviets prevented the possibility of the alternate outcome. The [[Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact]] of non-aggression was signed. In anticipation of the surprise attack and occupation of Poland by Nazi Germany, the pact included top secret provisions carving up Eastern Europe into [[spheres of influence]] of the two signatories, with the dividing line running through the territory of east-central Poland. The \"desirability of the maintenance of an independent Polish State\" was left to mutually agreed \"further political developments\" read the text, which was discovered years later.<ref name=\"Czubiński historia Polski 156-159\"/>{{Ref label|l|l|none}}\n\n===Military alliances===\n\nThe Soviet Union, having its own reasons to fear the German eastward expansionism, repeatedly negotiated with France and the United Kingdom, and through them made an offer to Poland of an anti-German alliance, similar to the earlier one made to Czechoslovakia. The British and the French sought the formation of a powerful political-military bloc, comprising the Soviet Union, Poland and [[Romania]] in the east, and France and Britain in the west.<ref name=\"Czubiński historia Polski 156-159\"/> As of May 1939, the Soviet conditions for signing an agreement with Britain and France were as follows: the right of the [[Red Army]] troops to pass through Polish territory, the termination of the [[Polish–Romanian Alliance]], and the limitation of the British guarantee to Poland to cover only Poland's western frontier with Germany. The Polish leaders believed that once on Polish territory the Soviet troops would not leave and throughout 1939 refused to agree to any arrangement which would allow Soviet troops to enter Poland.<ref name=\"Kochanski 44-48\"/>\n\nThe Polish unwillingness to accept the Soviet dangerous offer of free entry is illustrated by the quote of Marshall [[Edward Rydz-Śmigły]], commander-in-chief of the Polish armed forces, who said: \"With the Germans we run the risk of losing our liberty. With the Russians we will lose our soul\".<ref>Boris Meissner, \"The Baltic Question in World Politics\", The Baltic States in Peace and War (The Pennsylvania State University Press, 1978), 139–148</ref> The attitude of the Polish leadership was also reflected by Foreign Minister Józef Beck, who, apparently confident in the French and British declarations of support, asserted that the security of Poland was not going to be guaranteed by a \"Soviet or any other Russia\". The Soviets then turned to concluding the German offer of a treaty and the Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact was signed. The Soviet-Nazi cooperation had been making progress since May 1939, when [[Vyacheslav Molotov]] became the Soviet [[Ministry of Foreign Affairs (Soviet Union)|minister of foreign affairs]].<ref name=\"Davies Europe 991-998\"/>\n\nThe German military used a system of automated code for secret transfer of messages based on the [[Enigma machine]]. The constantly generated and altered code scheme was broken by Polish mathematicians led by [[Marian Rejewski]] and the discovery was shared with the French and the British before the outbreak of the war.

Before the end of the month, most of Poland was divided between the Germans and the Soviets.<ref name=\"Czubiński historia Polski 183-189\"/>\n\nThe German attack was not anticipated in a timely manner.

Their technical and organizational level, according to the historian Andrzej Leon Sowa, corresponded to that of the World War I period.<ref name=\"Brzoza Sowa Historia Polski 1918–1945 495–498\"/> The armed forces' strategic position was made more hopeless by the recent [[German occupation of Czechoslovakia]].

On 1 September the German navy positioned its old [[battleship]] ''[[SMS Schleswig-Holstein|Schleswig-Holstein]]'' to [[Battle of Westerplatte|shell Westerplatte]], a section of the Free City of Danzig, a defended enclave separate from the main city and awarded to Poland by the Treaty of Versailles in 1919. 53 navy ships were designated for action against Poland.<ref name=\"Czubiński historia Polski 171-174\"/><ref name=\"Brzoza Sowa Historia Polski 1918–1945 499–504\"/>\n\nAccording to [[Antoni Czubiński]], 1.2 million Polish troops had been mobilized, but some did not even have rifles.

The few limited air raids attempted by the British were ineffective and caused losses of life and equipment.

Crowds of civilian refugees fleeing to the east blocked roads and bridges. The Germans were also able to circumvent other concentrations of the Polish military and arrive in the rear of Polish formations.<ref name=\"Czubiński historia Polski 174-177\"/>\n\nAs the Polish armies were being destroyed or in retreat, the Germans took [[Częstochowa]] on 4 September, [[Kraków]] and [[Kielce]] on 6 September. The Polish government was evacuated to [[Volhynia]] and the supreme military commander Rydz-Śmigły left Warsaw on the night of 6 September and moved in the eastern direction toward [[Brest, Belarus|Brześć]]. General [[Walerian Czuma]] took over and organized the [[Siege of Warsaw (1939)|defense of the capital city]].<ref name=\"Czubiński historia Polski 180-183\"/> According to [[Halik Kochanski]], Rydz-Śmigły fled the capital and the Polish high command failed its army.<ref name=\"Kochanski 69-76\"/> Rydz-Śmigły's departure had disastrous effects on both the morale of the Polish armed forces and on his ability to exercise effective overall command.<ref name=\"Kochanski 86-90\"/>\n\nThe Germans began surrounding Warsaw on 9 September.<ref name=\"Davies Europe 1000-1013\"/> City president [[Stefan Starzyński]] played an especially prominent role in its defense.<ref name=\"Czubiński historia Polski 180-183\"/> The campaign's greatest [[Battle of the Bzura]] was fought west of the middle [[Vistula]] on 9–21 September. Heavy fighting took place also at a number of other locations, including the area of [[Tomaszów Lubelski]] (until 26 September), and a determined [[Battle of Lwów (1939)|defense of Lwów]] was mounted (against the German forces until 22 September, when the defenders surrendered to the Soviets upon their arrival). On 13 September, Marshal Rydz-Śmigły ordered all Polish forces to withdraw toward the so-called [[Romanian Bridgehead]] in southeastern Poland, next to the Romanian and Soviet borders, the area he designated to be the final defense bastion.<ref name=\"Czubiński historia Polski 180-183\"/><ref name=\"Czubiński historia Polski 183-189\"/><ref name=\"Davies Europe 1000-1013\"/><ref name=\"Brzoza Sowa Historia Polski 1918–1945 499–504\"/><ref name=\"Brzoza Sowa Historia Polski 1918–1945 504–511\"/>\n\nOn 11 September, foreign minister [[Józef Beck]] asked France to grant asylum to the Polish government and Romania to allow the transfer of the government members through its territory. On 12 September, the [[Anglo-French Supreme War Council]] deliberating in [[Abbeville]], France concluded that the Polish military campaign had already been resolved and that there was no point in launching an anti-German relief expedition.

Ethnic Ukrainians, Belarusians and Lithuanians, while themselves subjected to brutal occupation, generally received a more favorable treatment from the Nazis.

The living standards, following the initial collapse, kept gradually improving, many services were free or inexpensive and the poor and people with technical education fared better than under the Polish rule. The cities, of which Lviv and Białystok were particularly well-maintained by the Soviet authorities, were in much better shape than the countryside.

Wasilewska, an informal leader of Polish communists, was received by Stalin at the [[Moscow Kremlin|Kremlin]] on 28 June 1940. The event marked a beginning of reorientation of Soviet policies with respect to Poles, which would have momentous consequences for the next half-century. The Soviets undertook a number of conciliatory measures, such as organizing celebrations of the 85th anniversary of the death of the poet [[Adam Mickiewicz]] in November 1940 in Moscow, Lviv, and at other concentrations of Polish population, or expanding Polish language general and higher education activities in Soviet-controlled territories. Wasilewska and Berling pushed for the Polish division again in September 1942, and the issue then gained traction.<ref name=\"Czubiński historia Polski 193-198\"/><ref name=\"Brzoza Sowa Historia Polski 1918–1945 570–578\"/><ref name=\"Kochanski 376-383\"/>\n\nUnlike in German-occupied Poland, where open cooperation with the occupier was rare among the Polish elites, many Polish intellectuals, artists, literary figures, and journalists cooperated with the Soviets and their activity often included participation in [[Propaganda in the Soviet Union|Soviet propaganda]] undertakings.<ref name=\"Brzoza Sowa Historia Polski 1918–1945 581\"/>\n\nFollowing the [[Operation Barbarossa]] and the [[Sikorski–Mayski agreement]], in the summer of 1941 the exiled Poles were released under the declared amnesty.

Centrally commanded military conspiratorial activity was started with the [[Service for Poland's Victory]] (''Służba Zwycięstwu Polski'') organization, established on 27 September 1939. Poland's prewar political parties also resumed activity.<ref name=\"Czubiński historia Polski 193-198\"/> The Service was replaced by the [[Polish government-in-exile]] in [[Paris]] with the [[Union of Armed Struggle]] (''Związek Walki Zbrojnej''), placed under the command of General [[Kazimierz Sosnkowski]], a minister in that government.<ref name=\"Czubiński historia Polski 198-201\"/>\n\nIn June 1940 [[Władysław Sikorski]], prime minister in exile and chief military commander, appointed General [[Stefan Rowecki]], resident in Poland, to head the Union.<ref name=\"Lukowski 264–269\"/> [[Bataliony Chłopskie]], a partisan force of the peasant movement, was active from August 1940 and reached 150,000 participants by June 1944.<ref name=\"Brzoza 349–350\"/> The [[Home Army]] (''Armia Krajowa'' or AK), loyal to the government in exile then in [[London]] and a military arm of the [[Polish Underground State]], was formed from the Union of Armed Struggle and other groups in February 1942. In July its forces approached 200,000 sworn soldiers, who undertook many successful anti-Nazi operations.<ref name=\"Czubiński historia Polski 207-209\"/> [[Gwardia Ludowa]] and its successor [[Armia Ludowa]] were the much smaller leftist formations, backed by the Soviet Union and controlled by the [[Polish Workers' Party]]. The [[National Military Organization]] was a military structure of the [[National Party (Poland)|National Party]]. Its forces split in 1942 and again in 1944, with most joining the Home Army and the rest forming the ultra-nationalist [[National Armed Forces]] that operated separately.<ref name=\"Brzoza 349–350\"/> By mid-1944, partial coalescing of several underground formations had taken place<ref name=\"Brzoza Sowa Historia Polski 1918–1945 627–628\"/> and the AK membership may have reached some 400,000, but its supply of arms remained quite limited.<ref name=\"Czubiński historia Polski 207-209\"/><ref name=\"Lukowski 264–269\"/><ref name=\"Czubiński historia Polski 202-204\"/><ref name=\"Kochanski 278-285\"/> According to Czubiński, the AK counted 300,000 committed soldiers, who performed about 230,000 actions of sabotage and diversion throughout the war.<ref name=\"Czubiński historia Polski 218-220\"/> According to Zbigniew Mikołejko, 200,000 soldiers and civilians participated in AK activities during the war.<ref name=\"Mikolejko jeden drugiemu\"/> However, the Home Army's resources were so scarce that it could effectively equip only about 30,000 fighters in the spring of 1944.<ref name=\"Brzoza Sowa Historia Polski 1918–1945 627–628\"/> Partisan attacks were also hampered by the Nazi policy of retaliation against the civilian population, including mass executions of randomly rounded up individuals.<ref name=\"Kochanski 112-119\"/> The occupiers would typically kill one hundred Polish civilians for each German killed by the resistance.<ref name=\"Davies Victory 312\"/> The AK encountered difficulties establishing itself in the eastern provinces ([[Kresy]]) and in the western areas annexed to Germany. General Rowecki was betrayed and arrested by the Gestapo in June 1943.<ref name=\"Kochanski 278-285\"/>\n\nThe Underground State originated in April 1940, when the exile government planned to establish its three \"delegates\" in occupied Poland: for the General Government, the German-annexed areas and the Soviet-occupied zone. After the fall of France, the structure was revised to include only a [[Government Delegation for Poland|single delegate]].<ref name=\"Kochanski 112-119\"/> The Underground State was endorsed by Poland's main prewar political blocks, including the [[People's Party (Poland)|peasant]], [[Polish Socialist Party – Freedom, Equality, Independence|socialist]], [[National Party (Poland)|nationalist]] and [[Labor Party (Stronnictwo Pracy)|Catholic]] parties and absorbed many supporters of the [[Sanation]] rule, humbled by the 1939 defeat. The parties established clandestine cooperation in February 1940 and dedicated themselves to a future postwar parliamentary democracy in Poland. From autumn 1940, the \"State\" was led by a delegate ([[Cyryl Ratajski]]) appointed by the Polish government in London. The Underground State maintained the continuity of the Polish statehood in Poland and conducted a broad range of political, military, administrative, social, cultural, educational and other activities, within practical limits of the conspiratorial environment. In November 1942 [[Jan Karski]], a special emissary, was sent to London and later to [[Washington, D.C.|Washington]], to warn the Western Allies of the imminent extermination of the Jews in Poland. Karski was able to convey his personal observations to American Jewish leaders and he met with President [[Franklin D. Roosevelt|Roosevelt]].<ref name=\"Czubiński historia Polski 207-209\"/><ref name=\"Lukowski 264–269\"/>\n\n===After Operation Barbarossa===\n\n[[Leopold Trepper]], a Polish-Jewish communist, worked as a master spy and was the chief of the [[Red Orchestra (espionage)|Red Orchestra]] network in Western Europe. He became aware and informed Stalin of the Nazi-planned [[Operation Barbarossa]], but the Soviet leader did not take his — nor the similar alerts from his top intelligence officer in Japan, [[Richard Sorge#Wartime intelligence supplied by the Sorge Ring|Richard Sorge]] — advance warnings seriously regarding the imminent Nazi invasion.<ref name=\"Davies Victory 417\"/>\n\nIn Poland the communists, more active after the 1941 [[Operation Barbarossa|Nazi invasion of the Soviet Union]], and the [[National Armed Forces|right wing extremists]], neither joined the broad coalition nor recognized the Government Delegate. The situation of the [[Polish resistance movement in World War II|Polish armed resistance]] was made more difficult by the fact that the Allies now assigned Poland to the Soviet sphere of operations, and Britain refrained from or limited direct [[Special Operations Executive|support of resistance movements]] in central-eastern Europe.<ref name=\"Czubiński historia Polski 207-209\"/><ref name=\"Lukowski 264–269\"/><ref name=\"Kochanski 278-285\"/><ref name=\"Kochanski 285-290\"/>\n\n[[File:German announcement General Government Poland 1944.jpg|thumb|An announcement of fifty Poles tried and sentenced to death by a ''[[drumhead court-martial|Standgericht]]'' in retaliation for the assassination of one German policeman, 1944]]\n\nAfter Operation Barbarossa, the [[Soviet partisans]] also developed and became militarily active in the General Government. They were generally aligned with the Polish leftist Gwardia Ludowa and posed a significant threat to the authority of the AK, which had not adopted a policy of more direct and widespread confrontations with the Nazis until 1943. The Soviet partisans were especially prevalent in [[Belarus]] and elsewhere in [[Kresy]].{{Ref label|y|y|none}} The presence of the various partisan formations, who often represented irreconcilable political orientations, followed contradictory military strategies and were mutually hostile, including also the [[Jewish partisans|Jewish]], National Armed Forces, Bataliony Chłopskie (some right-, some left-wing), and of criminal armed bands preying on local populations, led to armed clashes, assassinations, murder, and a climate of chaos and uncertainty, as the Soviet armies, having established their superiority on the Eastern Front, approached Poland's prewar eastern boundaries.<ref name=\"Kochanski 278-285\"/><ref name=\"Kochanski 285-290\"/><ref name=\"Davies Victory 317-318\"/><ref name=\"Brzoza Sowa Historia Polski 1918–1945 630–637\"/>\n\nWith Stalin's encouragement, Polish communist institutions rival to the government-in-exile and the Underground State were established. They included the Polish Workers' Party (from January 1942) and the [[State National Council]] in occupied Poland, as well as the [[Union of Polish Patriots]] in the Soviet Union.<ref name=\"Lukowski 264–269\"/>\n\nThe [[Jewish Combat Organization]] groups undertook armed resistance activities in 1943. In April, the Germans began deporting the remaining Jews from the [[Warsaw Ghetto]], provoking the [[Warsaw Ghetto Uprising]] (19 April–16 May). The Polish-Jewish leaders knew that the rising would be crushed but they preferred to die fighting than wait to be deported to their deaths in the [[extermination camp|death camps]].<ref name=\"Czubiński historia Polski 207-209\"/>\n\nIn August 1943 and March 1944, the Underground State announced its long-term plan, partially designed to counter the attractiveness of some of the communist proposals. It promised [[representative democracy|parliamentary democracy]], [[land reform]], [[nationalization]] of the industrial base, more powerful [[trade union]]s, demands for territorial compensation from Germany, and re-establishment of the pre-1939 eastern border. Thus, the main difference between the Underground State and the communists, in terms of politics, amounted not to radical economic and social reforms, which were advocated by both sides, but to their attitudes towards national sovereignty, borders, and Polish-Soviet relations.<ref name=\"Lukowski 264–269\"/><ref name=\"Kochanski 384-386\"/>\n\n===Operation Tempest and the Warsaw Uprising===\n\n[[File:AK-soldiers Parasol Regiment Warsaw Uprising 1944.jpg|200px|right|thumb|[[Battalion Zośka]] soldiers in [[Wola]] during the [[Warsaw Uprising]]]]\n\nIn early 1943, the Home Army built up its forces in preparation for a national uprising.<ref name=\"Lukowski 264–269\"/> The situation was soon complicated by the continuing strength of Germany and the threat presented by the advance of the Soviets, who promoted a territorial and political vision of a future Poland that was at odds with what the Polish leaders were striving for. The [[Council of National Unity]], a quasi-parliament, was instituted in occupied Poland on 9 January 1944; it was chaired by [[Kazimierz Pużak]], a socialist. The plan for the establishment of Polish state authority ahead of the arrival of the Soviets was code-named [[Operation Tempest]] and began in late 1943. Its major implemented elements were the campaign of the [[27th Home Army Infantry Division (Poland)|27th Home Army Infantry Division]] in [[Volhynia]] (from February 1944), [[Operation Ostra Brama]] in [[Vilnius]] and the [[Warsaw Uprising]]. In most Polish-Soviet encounters, the Soviets and their allies ultimately opted not to cooperate with the Home Army and ruthlessly imposed their rule; in the case of the Warsaw Uprising, the Soviets waited for the Germans to defeat the insurgents. The [[National Armed Forces|forces of the Polish right-wing]] called for stopping the war against Germany and concentrating on fighting the communists and the Soviet threat.<ref name=\"Czubiński historia Polski 213-218\"/><ref name=\"Brzoza Sowa Historia Polski 1918–1945 642–650\"/>\n\nAs the Operation Tempest failed to achieve its goals in the disputed [[Kresy|eastern provinces]], the Soviets demanded that the Home Army be disbanded there and its underground soldiers enlist in the Soviet-allied [[First Polish Army (1944–45)|First Polish Army]]. The [[Home Army|AK]] commander [[Tadeusz Bór-Komorowski]] complied, disbanding in late July 1944 his formations east of the [[Bug River]] and ordering the fighters to join the army led by [[Zygmunt Berling]]. Some partisans obeyed, other refused, and many were arrested and persecuted by the Soviets.<ref name=\"Kochanski 392-402\"/>\n\nIn the summer of 1944, as the Soviet forces approached Warsaw, the AK prepared an uprising in the German-occupied capital city with the political intention of preempting an imposition of a communist government in Poland. The Polish supreme commander in London, General Sosnkowski, was opposed to the AK strategy of waging open warfare against the German forces on the eve of the arrival of the Soviet armies (the effective scope of those military undertakings was in any case limited because of insufficient resources and external pressures), as self-destructive for the AK. He dispatched General [[Leopold Okulicki]] to Poland in May 1944, instructing him not to allow such actions to proceed. Once in Poland, Okulicki pursued his own ideas instead and in Warsaw he became the most ardent proponent of an uprising there, pushing for a quick commencement of anti-German hostilities. Prime Minister [[Stanisław Mikołajczyk]], who thought an uprising in Warsaw would improve his bargaining position in the upcoming negotiations with Stalin, cabled on 27 July [[Jan Stanisław Jankowski]], the government delegate, declaring the [[Polish government-in-exile]]'s authorization for the issuance of an uprising proclamation by the Polish underground authorities in Warsaw, at a moment chosen by them. To some of the underground commanders, the German collapse and the entry of the Soviets appeared imminent, and the AK, led by Bór-Komorowski, launched the Warsaw Uprising on August 1. The insurgents' equipment and supplies would suffice for only several days of fighting and the uprising was planned to last no longer than that. On August 3 Mikołajczyk, conferring with Stalin in Moscow, announced an upcoming \"freeing of Warsaw any day now\" and asked for military help.<ref name=\"Czubiński historia Polski 218-220\"/><ref name=\"Czubiński historia Polski 213-218\"/><ref name=\"Brzoza Sowa Historia Polski 1918–1945 642–650\"/><ref name=\"Kochanski 392-402\"/><ref name=\"Davies Europe 1040-1044\"/> Stalin promised help for the insurgents, but noted that the Soviet armies were still separated from Warsaw by powerful and thus far undefeated concentrations of enemy troops.<ref name=\"Cel Warszawa\"/>\n\n[[File:Warsaw_1944.jpg|200px|thumb|right|Warsaw Uprising in the [[Warsaw Old Town|Old Town]]]]\n\nIn Warsaw, the Germans turned out to be still overwhelmingly strong and the Soviet leaders and their forces nearby, not consulted in advance, contrary to the insurgents' expectations gave little assistance. Stalin had no interest in the uprising's success and following the failure of the talks with Mikołajczyk, the Soviet [[TASS]] information agency stated in the August 13 broadcast that \"the responsibility for the events in Warsaw rests entirely with the Polish émigré circles in London\".<ref name=\"Cel Warszawa\"/> The Poles appealed to the Western Allies for help. The [[Royal Air Force]] and the Polish Air Force based in Italy dropped some arms but little could be accomplished without Soviet involvement. Urged by the communist [[Polish Committee of National Liberation]] and the Western leaders, Stalin eventually allowed airdrops for the Warsaw insurgents and provided limited military assistance. Soviet supply flights continued from 13 to 29 September and an American relief operation was allowed to land on Soviet-controlled territory, but by that time the area under insurgent control had been greatly reduced and much of the dropped material was lost. General Berling's failed but costly attempt to support the fighters on 15–23 September using his Polish forces (First Army units crossed the [[Vistula]] but were slaughtered in a battle over the bridgehead) derailed Berling's own career.<ref name=\"Czubiński historia Polski 218-220\"/><ref name=\"Czubiński historia Polski 213-218\"/><ref name=\"Davies Europe 1040-1044\"/><ref name=\"Kochanski 402-426\"/>{{Ref label|z|z|none}} The Soviets halted their western push at the Vistula for several months, [[Jassy–Kishinev Offensive|directing their attention south]] [[Belgrade Offensive|toward the Balkans]].<ref name=\"Davies Victory 32, 117-118\"/><ref name=\"Davies Victory 119-121\"/>\n\nIn the Polish capital the AK formations initially took over considerable portions of the city, but from August 4 they had to limit their efforts to defense and the territory under Polish control kept shrinking. The Warsaw AK district had 50,000 members, of whom perhaps 10% had firearms. They faced a reinforced German special corps of 22,000 largely [[Schutzstaffel|SS]] troops and various regular army and auxiliary units, up to 50,000 soldiers total. The Polish command had planned to establish a provisional Polish administration to greet the arriving Soviets, but came nowhere close to meeting this goal. The Germans and their allies engaged in mass slaughter of the civilian population, including between 40,000 and 50,000 [[Wola massacre|massacred in the districts of Wola]], [[Ochota massacre|Ochota]] and [[Mokotów]]. The SS and auxiliary units recruited from the Soviet Army deserters (the [[36th Waffen Grenadier Division of the SS|Dirlewanger Brigade]] and the [[S.S. Sturmbrigade R.O.N.A.|R.O.N.A. Brigade]]) were particularly brutal.<ref name=\"Czubiński historia Polski 213-218\"/><ref name=\"Davies Europe 1040-1044\"/><ref name=\"Davies Victory 119-121\"/><ref name=\"Davies Victory 210\"/><ref name=\"Davies Victory 316\"/><ref name=\"Brzoza Sowa Historia Polski 1918–1945 654–662\"/>\n\nAfter the uprising's surrender on 2 October, the AK fighters were given the status of prisoners-of-war by the Germans but the civilian population remained unprotected and the survivors were punished and evacuated. The Polish casualties are estimated to be at least 150,000 civilians killed, in addition to the fewer than 20,000 AK soldiers. The German forces lost over two thousand men.<ref name=\"Brzoza Sowa Historia Polski 1918–1945 654–662\"/><ref name=\"Zaremba Biedni Polacy\"/> Under three thousand of the First Polish Army soldiers died in the failed rescue attempt.<ref name=\"Przyczolek 219–220\"/> 150,000 civilians were sent to labour camps in the [[Reich]] or shipped to concentration camps such as [[Ravensbrück concentration camp|Ravensbrück]], [[Auschwitz concentration camp|Auschwitz]], and [[Mauthausen-Gusen concentration camp|Mauthausen]].<ref name=\"Kochanski 402-426\"/><ref name=\"Davies Victory 119-121\"/><ref name=\"Davies God's Playground II 355\"/> The city was [[Planned destruction of Warsaw|almost totally demolished]] by the German punitive bombing raids, but only after being systematically looted of works of art and other property, which were then taken to Germany.<ref name=\"Davies Victory 342\"/> General Sosnkowski, who criticized the Allied inaction, was relieved of his command. Following the defeat of Operation Tempest and the Warsaw Uprising, the remaining resistance in Poland (the [[Polish Underground State|Underground State]] and the AK) ended up greatly destabilized, weakened and with damaged reputation, at the moment when the international decision making processes impacting Poland's future were about to enter their final phase. The Warsaw Uprising allowed the Germans to largely destroy the AK as a fighting force, but the main beneficiaries were the Soviets and the communists, who were able to impose a communist government on postwar Poland with reduced risk of armed resistance. The Soviets and the allied First Polish Army, having resumed their offensive, entered Warsaw on 17 January 1945. In January 1945, the Home Army was officially disbanded.<ref name=\"Czubiński historia Polski 213-218\"/><ref name=\"Davies Europe 1040-1044\"/><ref name=\"Davies Victory 119-121\"/><ref name=\"Davies Victory 320\"/><ref name=\"Kochanski 499-515\"/> The AK, placed under General Okulicki after General Bór-Komorowski became a German prisoner, was in late 1944 extremely demoralized. Okulicki issued the order dissolving the AK on 19 January, having been authorized to do so by President [[Władysław Raczkiewicz|Raczkiewicz]]. The civilian Underground State structure remained in existence and hoped to participate in the future government of Poland.<ref name=\"Kochanski 520-527\"/>\n\n==The Holocaust in Poland==\n\n{{Main|The Holocaust in Poland|War crimes in occupied Poland during World War II}}\n\n===Jews in Poland===\n\nDespite the various forms of anti-Jewish harassment taking place in the late prewar Poland, the [[History of the Jews in Poland|Jewish community]] there was the largest in Europe and thrived.<ref name=\"Davies Europe 978\"/>\n\nIn 1938, the Polish government passed a law depriving of the Polish citizenship those who had lived outside of Poland for over five years. The laws was aimed at and used to prevent the tens of thousands of Polish Jews in Austria and Germany, threatened or expelled by the Nazi regime, from returning to Poland.<ref name=\"Kochanski 27-32\"/>\n\nThe Polish courier Jan Karski wrote on the Jewish, Polish and German relations in December 1939. In his opinion, some Poles felt contempt and dismay observing the barbarian anti-Jewish methods of the Nazis, while other watched their activities with interest and admiration. He warned of the threat of demoralization of broad segments of Polish society because of the narrow common ground that the Nazis shared with many ethnic Poles on the Jewish issue.<ref name=\"Karski Gross Zagadnienie\"/> Local [[antisemitism]], encouraged by the Nazis and augmented by their propaganda, resulted during the war in many instances of violence directed against the Jews.<ref name=\"Brzoza Sowa Historia Polski 1918–1945 555–569\"/> According to Laurence Weinbaum who quotes Aleksander Smolar, \"in wartime Polish society ... there was no stigma of collaboration attached to acting against the Jews\".<ref name=\"Weinbaum Confronting\"/> According to the writer and researcher [[Anna Bikont]], most Jews who escaped the [[Nazi ghettos|ghettos]] could not have survived the war even if they were in possession of material resources and social connections, because ethnic Poles diligently and persistently excluded them from Polish society.<ref name=\"Bikont: Na każdym kroku\"/>\n\n===Nazi persecution and elimination of ghettos===\n\n[[Image:Bundesarchiv_N_1576_Bild-003,_Warschau,_Bettelnde_Kinder.jpg|thumb|Starving Jewish children in the [[Warsaw Ghetto]] (1940–1943), during the German occupation of Poland]]\n\nPersecution of the Jews by the Nazi occupation government, particularly in the urban areas, began immediately after the commencement of the occupation. In the first year and a half, the Germans confined themselves to stripping the Jews of their property, herding them into ghettos (approximately 400 were established beginning in October 1939) and putting them into forced labor in war-related industries.<ref name=\"Kochanski 107-112\"/> Thousands of Jews survived by managing to stay outside the ghettos.<ref name=\"Davies Victory 309-311\"/> During this period, a Jewish so-called community leadership, [[Judenrat]], was required by the Germans in every town with a substantial Jewish population and was able to some extent to bargain with the Germans.<ref name=\"Kochanski 107-112\"/> Already during this initial stage tens of thousands of Jews died because of factors such as overcrowding, disease and starvation.<ref name=\"Davies Victory 358-364\"/> Others survived, supported by the Jewish social self-help agency and the informal trading and smuggling of food and necessities into the ghettos.<ref name=\"Kochanski 294-298\"/>\n\nThe ghettos were eliminated when their inhabitants were shipped to slave labor and extermination camps. The [[Łódź Ghetto]], one of the largest and most isolated, lasted also the longest (from April 1940 until August 1944), because goods were manufactured there for the Nazi war economy.<ref name=\"Brzoza Sowa Historia Polski 1918–1945 555–569\"/><ref name=\"Kochanski 298-303\"/> The deportations from the [[Warsaw Ghetto]] began in July 1942. They were facilitated by collaborators, such as the [[Jewish Ghetto Police|Jewish police]], and opposed by the resistance, including the [[Jewish Combat Organization]] (ŻOB).<ref name=\"Kochanski 303-306\"/> An estimated 500,000 Jews died in the ghettos, and further 250,000 were murdered during their elimination.<ref name=\"Brzoza Sowa Historia Polski 1918–1945 555–569\"/>\n\nWhile many Jews reacted to their fate with disbelief and passivity, revolts did take place, including at the [[Treblinka extermination camp|Treblinka]] and [[Sobibór extermination camp|Sobibór]] camps and at a number of ghettos. The leftist ŻOB was established in the Warsaw Ghetto in July 1942 and was soon commanded by [[Mordechai Anielewicz]]. As the final liquidation of the remaining ghetto population was commenced by the Nazis on 19 April 1943, hundreds of Jewish fighters revolted. The [[Warsaw Ghetto Uprising]] lasted until May 16 and resulted in thousands of Jews killed and tens of thousands transported to Treblinka. The [[Home Army|Polish underground]] and some Warsaw residents assisted the ghetto fighters.<ref name=\"Kochanski 306-313\"/>\n\n===Extermination of Jews===\n\n[[Image:Auschwitz I Entrance.jpg|thumb|The entrance to the [[Auschwitz concentration camp|Auschwitz I concentration camp]], established by Nazi Germany in Poland]]\n\nAfter the [[Operation Barbarossa|German attack on the Soviet Union]] in June 1941, special extermination squads (the ''[[Einsatzgruppen]]'') were organised to kill Jews in the areas of eastern Poland which had been annexed by the Soviets in 1939.<ref name=\"Overy 300-301\"/> The Nazi anti-Jewish persecutions assumed the characteristics and proportions of [[genocide]], and, from the fall of 1941, of the organized [[Final Solution]].<ref name=\"Davies Victory 358-364\"/><ref name=\"Mędykowski Warszawski Pogromy\"/> The [[Chełmno extermination camp]] near [[Łódź]] was put into operation first.

Especially in the early weeks of the German offensive, many thousands of Jews were murdered by members of local communities in the western parts of the previously Soviet zone, such as the [[Baltic states|Baltic countries]], eastern Poland, and western [[Ukraine]]. The [[pogrom]]s, encouraged by the Germans, were sometimes perpetrated primarily or exclusively by the locals, including Lithuanians, Belarusians, Ukrainians and Poles.<ref name=\"Mędykowski Warszawski Pogromy\"/><ref name=\"Kochanski 291-294\"/>\n\nIn 1942, the Germans engaged in systematic killing of the Jews, beginning with the Jewish population of the General Government. The General Government had the largest in Europe population of Jews and was designated to be the primary location of Nazi installations for the elimination of Jews.<ref name=\"Davies Victory 167-168\"/> Six [[extermination camp]]s ([[Auschwitz concentration camp|Auschwitz]], [[Bełżec extermination camp|Bełżec]], [[Chełmno extermination camp|Chełmno]], [[Majdanek concentration camp|Majdanek]], [[Sobibór extermination camp|Sobibór]] and [[Treblinka extermination camp|Treblinka]]) were established in which the most extreme measure of [[the Holocaust]], the [[The Holocaust in Poland|mass murder of millions of Jews from Poland and other countries]], was carried out between 1942 and 1945.<ref name=\"Overy 300-301\"/> Nearly three million Polish Jews were killed, most in death camps during the so-called [[Operation Reinhard]].<ref name=\"Kochanski 298-303\"/>\n\nPrisoners of many nationalities were kept at Auschwitz and parts of the complex were used as a brutal and deadly labor camp, but about 80% of the arriving Jews were directly selected for death (some 900,000 people). Auschwitz, unlike Treblinka or Bełżec, was not strictly a death camp, but it still might have produced the highest number of Jewish victims.<ref name=\"Davies Victory 358-364\"/><ref name=\"Davies Victory 327-328\"/>{{Ref label|k|k|none}} Of Poland's prewar Jewish population of about or above three million, about or above 10% survived the war.<ref name=\"Brzoza Sowa Historia Polski 1918–1945 606–609\"/><ref name=\"Lukowski 260–261\"/> Davies wrote of some 150,000 Jews surviving the war in Poland.<ref name=\"Davies Victory 358-364\"/> Between 50,000 and 100,000 survived in hiding helped by other Poles according to Kochanski, between 30,000 and 60,000 according to Sowa. About 250,000 escaped German-occupied Poland and went mostly to the Soviet Union. At Treblinka (a site that, together with Auschwitz, produced the highest number of Jewish victims) and other extermination locations, [[Heinrich Himmler]] ordered measures intended to conceal the Nazi crimes and prevent their future detection.<ref name=\"Kochanski 298-303\"/><ref name=\"Brzoza Sowa Historia Polski 1918–1945 606–609\"/>\n\nThe [[Romani people]] were also marked by the Nazis for immediate elimination. Of the 80,000 Romani living in Poland, 30,000 survived the German occupation.<ref name=\"Brzoza Sowa Historia Polski 1918–1945 606–609\"/>\n\n===Efforts to save Jews===\n\nSome Poles tried to save Jews. In September 1942, the [[Provisional Committee to Aid Jews]] (''Tymczasowy Komitet Pomocy Żydom'') was founded on the initiative of [[Zofia Kossak-Szczucka]]. This body later became the Council to Aid Jews (''Rada Pomocy Żydom''), known by the code-name [[Żegota]] and under the auspices of the [[Government Delegation for Poland]].<ref name=\"Czubiński historia Polski 207-209\"/> Żegota is particularly noted for its children-saving operation led by [[Irena Sendler]]. Jewish children were smuggled out of the [[Warsaw Ghetto]] before the ghetto was eliminated and thus saved.<ref name=\"Davies Victory 374\"/> (See also an example of the village that helped Jews: [[Markowa]]). Because of such actions, Polish citizens have the highest number of [[Righteous Among the Nations]] awards at the [[Yad Vashem]] Museum.<ref>{{cite web| url = http://www1.yadvashem.org/yv/en/righteous/statistics.asp| title = The Righteous Among The Nations| date = January 1, 2012| accessdate = September 21, 2012| publisher = yadvashem.org}}</ref> Thousands of Jews were saved with the help of the [[Ukrainian Greek Catholic Church|Greek Catholic]] [[Metropolitan bishop|Metropolitan]] [[Andrey Sheptytsky]] in western Ukraine.<ref name=\"Davies Victory 376-377\"/>\n\nHelping Jews was extremely dangerous because people involved exposed themselves and their families to Nazi punishment by death. The official policies of the Polish government in exile and the Polish Underground State called for providing assistance to the Jews. However, they reacted to tragic events with delays and were hampered by what General [[Stefan Rowecki]], chief of the armed underground, characterized as overwhelmingly antisemitic attitudes of Polish society.

Under French pressure, On 30 September 1939 [[Władysław Raczkiewicz]] was appointed as president and General [[Władysław Sikorski]] became prime minister and commander-in-chief of the Polish armed forces, reconstructed in the West and as an underground activity in occupied Poland. The exile government was authorized by the [[Sanation]] government leaders interned in Romania and was conceived as a continuation of the prewar government, but was beset by strong tensions between the sympathizers of the Sanation regime, led by President Raczkiewicz and General [[Kazimierz Sosnkowski]], and [[Front Morges|anti-Sanation opposition]], led by Prime Minister Sikorski, General [[Józef Haller]], and politicians from the Polish parties persecuted in the past in Sanation Poland. The 1935 [[April Constitution of Poland]], previously rejected by the opposition as illegitimate, was retained for the sake of continuity of the national government. President Raczkiewicz agreed not to use his extraordinary powers, granted by that constitution, except in agreement with the prime minister. There were calls for a war tribunal prosecution of the top leaders deemed responsible for the 1939 defeat. Sikorski blocked such attempts, but allowed forms of persecution of many exiles, [[Piłsudskiite|people seen as compromised]] by their past role in Poland's ruling circles.<ref name=\"Lukowski 255–256\"/><ref name=\"Czubiński historia Polski 198-201\"/>\n\nA quasi-parliamentary and advisory [[National Council of Poland|National Council]] was established in December 1939. It was chaired by the Polish senior statesman [[Ignacy Jan Paderewski|Ignacy Paderewski]]. The vice-chairmen were [[Stanisław Mikołajczyk]], a [[People's Party (Poland)|peasant movement]] leader, [[Herman Lieberman]], a [[Polish Socialist Party|socialist]], and [[Tadeusz Bielecki]], a [[National Party (Poland)|nationalist]].<ref name=\"Lukowski 255–256\"/><ref name=\"Czubiński historia Polski 198-201\"/>\n\nThe war was expected to end soon in an Allied victory and the government's goal was to reestablish the Polish state in pre-1939 borders, augmented by [[East Prussia]], [[Gdańsk|Danzig]], and the planned significant adjustments of the western border, all to be obtained at the expense of Germany. The government considered Poland to be in a state of war with Germany, but not with the Soviet Union, the relationship with which was not clearly specified.{{Ref label|f|f|none}} The eastern border problem placed the Polish government on a collision course not only with the Soviets, but also with the Western Allies, whose many politicians, including [[Winston Churchill]], kept thinking of Poland's proper eastern boundary in terms of the \"[[Curzon Line]]\". The exile government in Paris was recognized by France, Britain, and many other countries and was highly popular in occupied Poland. By the spring of 1940, an 82,000 strong army was mobilized in France and elsewhere. Polish soldiers and ships fought in the [[Norwegian Campaign]].<ref name=\"Czubiński historia Polski 198-201\"/><ref name=\"Kochanski 212-214\"/><ref name=\"Brzoza Sowa Historia Polski 1918–1945 512–521\"/>\n \n[[Battle of France|France was invaded and defeated by Germany]]. The Polish Army units, dispersed and attached to various French formations, fought in the defense of France and covered the French retreat, losing 1,400 men. On 18 June 1940, Sikorski went to England and made arrangements for the evacuation of the Polish government and armed forces to the [[British Isles]].

Polish soldiers and others imprisoned in the Soviet Union since 1939 were released and the formation of a Polish army there was agreed, intended to fight on the [[Eastern Front (World War II)|Eastern Front]], help the [[Red Army]] to liberate Poland and establish a sovereign Polish state. Other issues, including Poland's borders, were left to be determined in the future. A Polish-Soviet military agreement was signed on 14 August; it attempted to specify the political and operational conditions for the functioning of the Polish army.<ref name=\"Kochanski 163-170\"/> Sikorski's preference, stated around 1 September, was for the Polish army to be deployed in defense of the [[Caucasus]] oil fields, which would allow it to maintain close contacts with the British forces.<ref name=\"Kochanski 170-173\"/>\n\nTo resolve the various problems that surfaced during the recruitment and training of the Polish divisions and concerning their planned use, Sikorski went to the Soviet Union, where he negotiated with Stalin. The two leaders announced a common declaration \"of friendship and mutual assistance\" on 4 December 1941.<ref name=\"Kochanski 182-187\"/> But political and practical difficulties continued; for example the Soviets were unable or unwilling to properly feed and supply the Poles.

Its 60,000 soldiers grew to 100,000 by mid-1945.

[[Communism in Poland|Polish communist]] institutions rival to those of the main national independence and pro-Western movement were established in Poland in January 1942 (the [[Polish Workers' Party]]) and in the Soviet Union (the [[Union of Polish Patriots]]).<ref name=\"Lukowski 264–269\"/><ref name=\"Czubiński historia Polski 210-213\"/> Early in 1943, the Polish communists (their delegation led by [[Władysław Gomułka]]) engaged in Warsaw in negotiations with the [[Government Delegation for Poland|Delegation]] of the government in exile, but no common understanding was arrived at and the Delegation terminated the talks after the Soviet-Polish breach in diplomatic relations caused by the dispute concerning the [[Katyn massacre]]. The Polish Workers' Party formulated its separate program and from November was officially under Gomułka's leadership.<ref name=\"Eisler Siedmiu 178–185\"/> On the initiative of the Union of Polish Patriots, presided by [[Wanda Wasilewska]], in the spring of 1943 the Soviets began recruiting for a [[Polish Armed Forces in the East#Berling Army: 1943-1945|leftist Polish army]] led by [[Zygmunt Berling]], a Polish Army colonel, to replace the \"treacherous\" Anders' army that left. The [[Polish 1st Tadeusz Kościuszko Infantry Division|Kościuszko Division]] was rushed to its first military engagement and fought at the [[Battle of Lenino]] on 12–13 October. The Soviet-based communist faction, organized around the [[Central Bureau of Polish Communists]] (activated January 1944), directed by such future [[Stalinism in Poland|Stalinist Poland's]] ruling personalities as [[Jakub Berman]], [[Hilary Minc]], and [[Roman Zambrowski]], was increasingly influential. They also had a prevailing sway on the formation of Berling's [[First Polish Army (1944–45)|First Polish Army]] in 1943–44.<ref name=\"Kochanski 376-383\"/><ref name=\"Lukowski 264–269\"/><ref name=\"Czubiński historia Polski 210-213\"/>\n\nIn April 1943, the Germans discovered the graves of 4,000 or more Polish officers at [[Katyn (rural locality)|Katyn]] near [[Smolensk]]. The Polish government, suspecting the Soviets to be the perpetrators of an atrocity, requested the [[International Committee of the Red Cross|Red Cross]] to investigate. The Soviets denied involvement and the request was soon withdrawn by Sikorski under British and American pressure, but Stalin reacted by \"suspending\" diplomatic relations with the Polish government in exile on 25 April. The Katyn massacre information was suppressed during and after the war by the British, to whom the revelation was an embarrassment and presented a political difficulty.<ref name=\"Davies Europe 1000-1013\"/><ref name=\"Lukowski 264–269\"/><ref name=\"Kochanski 338-344\"/>\n\nPrime Minister Sikorski, the most prominent of the Polish exile leaders, was [[1943 Gibraltar B-24 crash|killed in an air crash]] near [[Gibraltar]] on 4 July 1943. Sikorski was succeeded as head of the government in exile by Stanisław Mikołajczyk and by Kazimierz Sosnkowski as the top military chief. Sikorski had been willing to work closely with Churchill, including on the issue of cooperation with the Soviets. The prime minister believed that Poland's strategic and economic weaknesses would be eliminated by a takeover of German East Prussia, Pomerania and Silesia and that Polish territorial concessions in the east were feasible. On the other hand, Sikorski was credited with preventing the Soviet territorial demands from being granted in the [[Anglo-Soviet Treaty of 1942]]. After his death, the Polish government's position within the Allied coalition deteriorated further and the body splintered into quarreling factions.<ref name=\"Lukowski 264–269\"/><ref name=\"Czubiński historia Polski 210-213\"/><ref name=\"Davies Victory 182-183\"/><ref name=\"Kochanski 325-333\"/>\n\n===Decline of Government-in-Exile===\n\nAt the [[Moscow Conference (1943)|Moscow Conference]] of foreign ministers of the three Allied great powers (October 1943), at the request of the Polish government borders were not discussed, but US President [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] had already expressed his support for Britain's approval of the [[Curzon Line]] as the future Polish-Soviet boundary. The powers represented divided Europe into spheres of influence and Poland was placed within the Soviet sphere. The Poles were also disappointed by a lack of progress regarding the resumption of Polish-Soviet diplomatic ties, an urgent issue, because the Soviet armies were moving toward Poland's 1939 frontiers.<ref name=\"Kochanski 349-354\"/>\n\nIn November–December 1943, the [[Tehran Conference]] of the Allied leaders took place. President Roosevelt and Prime Minister Churchill agreed with Stalin on the issue of using the Curzon Line as the basis of Poland's new eastern border and on compensating Poland with lands taken from Germany. The strategic war alliance with the Soviets inevitably outweighed the Western loyalty toward the Polish government and people. The Poles were not consulted or properly informed of the three Allied leaders' decisions.<ref name=\"Lukowski 264–269\"/><ref name=\"Kochanski 354-357\"/>\n\nWith the Western Allies stalling a serious offensive undertaking from the west,{{Ref label|j|j|none}} it was clear that it would be the Soviet Union who would enter Poland and drive off Nazi Germans. The Soviet offensive aimed at taking the [[Vistula]] basin commenced in January 1944.<ref name=\"Davies Europe 1036-1039\"/> Churchill applied pressure to Prime Minister Mikołajczyk, demanding accommodation with the Soviets, including on the borders issue. As the Red Army was marching into Poland defeating the Nazis, Stalin toughened his stance against the Polish government in exile, wanting not only the recognition of the proposed frontiers, but also a resignation from the government of all elements 'hostile to the Soviet Union', which meant President Raczkiewicz, armed forces commander Sosnkowski, and other ministers.<ref name=\"Lukowski 264–269\"/>\n\nThe Underground State governing structures were formed by the [[People's Party (Poland)|Peasant Alliance]], the [[Polish Socialist Party|Socialist Party]], the [[National Party (Poland)|National Alliance]] and the [[Labor Party (Stronnictwo Pracy)|Labour Alliance]].

The Polish government in London was losing its already weak influence on the views of the British and American governments.<ref name=\"Kochanski 285-290\"/>\n\nThe British and Soviet demands on the exile government were made in January 1944, in the context of a possible renewal of Polish-Soviet diplomatic relations and, contingent on the Polish agreement, a Soviet consent for an independent, presumably \"[[Finlandization|Finlandized]]\" Polish state. Following a refusal to accept the conditions by the Polish government, the Soviets engaged in supporting only the leftist government structures they were in process of facilitating, allowing contacts with Mikołajczyk, but already within the framework of communist control.<ref name=\"Brzoza 364–374\"/><ref name=\"Kochanski 445-454\"/>{{Ref label|q|q|none}}\n\nIn the aftermath of the controversial visit of [[Oskar R.

According to Czubiński, the Soviet Union was responsible for the deaths of some 50,000 of the exterminated persons.<ref name=\"Czubiński historia Polski 223-226\"/>\n\nApproximately 90% of Polish Jews perished; most of those who survived did so by fleeing to the Soviet Union.<ref name=\"Kochanski 119-124\"/><ref name=\"Trela-Mazur\"/><ref name=\"Kochanski 298-303\"/><ref name=\"Lukowski 260–261\"/> 380,000 Polish Jews were estimated to have survived the war. According to an estimate of the [[Central Committee of Polish Jews]], 50,000 Jews survived in Poland. Close to 300,000 Jews found themselves in Poland soon after the war. For a number of reasons, including [[Anti-Jewish violence in Poland, 1944–46|antisemitic activities]] such as the [[Kielce pogrom]] of 1946, [[Żydokomuna]] accusations, loss of families, communities and property, desire to emigrate to [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]] or to places in the West deemed more advantageous than post-war Poland, most of the surviving Jews left Poland in several stages after the war. The goal of Polish communist authorities was a state populated by ethnic Poles and the officials often informally facilitated departures of the Jews.<ref name=\"Kochanski 545-552\"/>\n\nThe heaviest losses among ethnic Poles were experienced by people with secondary and higher education, who were targeted by the occupiers and of whom a third or more had not survived. Academics and professional people suffered the most. According to Kochanski, only about 10% of the human losses of Poland were a result of military action; the rest came from intentional exterminations, persecutions, war and occupation hardships and the attendant attrition.<ref name=\"Kochanski 532-536\"/> 800,000 Poles became permanently disabled and large numbers failed to return from abroad, which further reduced the manpower potential of Poland.<ref name=\"Czubiński historia Polski 223-226\"/> 105,000 service people, or about one-half of the soldiers enlisted in the [[Polish Armed Forces in the West]], returned to Poland after the war.<ref name=\"Kochanski 552-563\"/>{{Ref label|x|x|none}}\n\nThe war destroyed 38% of Poland's national assets.<ref name=\"Czubiński historia Polski 223-226\"/> A substantial majority of Polish industrial installations and agricultural infrastructure had been lost.

The [[Armia Ludowa]] was its army. The Polish communist centers in Warsaw and in Moscow initially operated separately and had different visions of cooperation with the Soviet Union and regarding other issues. In the spring of 1944, the KRN sent a delegation to the Soviet Union, where it gained Stalin's recognition and the two branches began working together. In intense negotiations, the two Polish communist groups agreed to establish the [[Polish Committee of National Liberation]] (PKWN), a sort of temporary government.<ref name=\"Kochanski 384-386\"/><ref name=\"Czubiński historia Polski 210-213\"/>\n\nAs the Soviets advanced through Poland in 1944 and 1945, the German administration collapsed. The communist-controlled PKWN was installed in July 1944 in [[Lublin]], the first major Polish city within the new boundaries to be seized by the Soviets from the Nazis, and began to take over the administration of the country as the Germans retreated. The Polish government in London formally protested the establishment of the PKWN.<ref name=\"Kochanski 445-454\"/> The PKWN was led by [[Edward Osóbka-Morawski]], a socialist, and included other non-communists. The [[PKWN Manifesto]] was proclaimed in [[Chełm]] on July 22, initiating the crucial [[land reform]]. The agrarian reform, according to Norman Davies, was moderate and very popular.<ref name=\"Davies Victory 344-345\"/><ref name=\"Kochanski 426-433\"/><ref name=\"Czubiński historia Polski 229-233\"/>{{Ref label|b|b|none}} The communists constituted only a small, but highly organized and influential minority in the forming and gaining strength Polish pro-Soviet camp, which also included leaders and factions from such main political blocks as the agrarian, socialist, [[Zionism|Zionist]], and nationalist movements. The Polish [[Left-wing politics|Left]] in particular, with considerable support from the peasant movement leaders, both critical in respect to the [[Second Polish Republic|Second Republic]]'s record, was inclined to accept the Soviet territorial concepts and called for the creation of a more egalitarian society. They became empowered and commenced the formation of the new Polish administration, disregarding the existing Underground State structures.<ref name=\"Czubiński historia Polski 210-213\"/><ref name=\"Czubiński historia Polski 220-222\"/>\n\nThe so-called [[Provisional Government of the Republic of Poland]] was established at the end of 1944 in Lublin and was recognized by the Soviet Union, Czechoslovakia and [[Yugoslavia]].

The Underground State in Poland, through its [[Council of National Unity]] that operated in hiding, issued a more measured and pragmatic response, regretting the sacrifices imposed on Poland but expecting a representative government established and committing itself to adapt to the situation and to promote \"friendly and peaceful relations\" with the Soviet Union.<ref name=\"Kochanski 499-515\"/> The council declared its readiness to participate in the consultations leading to the formation of the government of national unity.<ref name=\"Brzoza Sowa Historia Polski 1918–1945 549–553\"/>\n\nThe tripartite Allied commission made up of [[Vyacheslav Molotov]] and the British and American ambassadors in Moscow worked on the composition of the Polish government of national unity from 23 February, but the negotiations soon stalled because of different interpretations of the Yalta Conference agreements. The former prime minister in exile Stanisław Mikołajczyk, approached by representatives of the communist-controlled Provisional Government, refused to make a separate deal with that body, but on 15 April made a statement of acceptance of the Yalta decisions.<ref name=\"Kochanski 499-515\"/><ref name=\"Brzoza Sowa Historia Polski 1918–1945 549–553\"/>\n\nBecause of the continuing disagreement on the composition of the government of national unity, Churchill convinced Mikołajczyk to take part in a conference in Moscow in June 1945, where he and other Polish democrats agreed with Stalin to a temporary deal (until the elections promised to take place soon, but with no specific time frame provided or even discussed) excluding the government in exile.<ref name=\"Kochanski 532-536\"/><ref name=\"Czubiński historia Polski 220-222\"/> Mikołajczyk was perceived in the West as the only reasonable Polish politician.<ref name=\"Davies Victory 408\"/>\n\nBased on the understanding reached in Moscow by the three powers with Mikołajczyk's help, the [[Provisional Government of National Unity|Government of National Unity]] was constituted on 28 June 1945, with Osóbka-Morawski as prime minister, and [[Władysław Gomułka]] and Mikołajczyk as deputy prime ministers. Mikołajczyk returned to Poland with [[Stanisław Grabski]] in July and was enthusiastically greeted by large crowds in several Polish cities.

The government was charged with conducting elections and normalizing the situation in Poland. The exile government in London, no longer recognized by the great powers, remained in existence until 1991.<ref name=\"Czubiński historia Polski 229-233\"/><ref name=\"Czubiński historia Polski 220-222\"/><ref name=\"Kochanski 536-537\"/>\n\n===Persecution of opposition===\n\nPersecution of the opposition intensified in October 1944, when the PKWN authorities encountered widespread loyalty problems among the now conscripted military personnel and other sections of Polish society. The enforcement of the communist rule was undertaken by the [[NKVD]] and the Polish security services, all backed by the massive presence of the Red Army in Poland.<ref name=\"Kochanski 426-433\"/> Potential political opponents of the communists were subjected to Soviet terror campaigns, with many of them arrested, executed or tortured.

Its activities were directed against the communist [[Provisional Government of the Republic of Poland|Provisional Government]]. However, as a result of Okulicki's arrest by the NKVD in March and the persecution, NIE ceased to exist.

They were all arrested and taken to Moscow to await a trial. The Polish communist Provisional Government and the Western leaders were not informed by the Soviets of the arrests.

The Polish Left's cooperation with the Stalin's regime made the preservation of a Polish state within favorable borders possible. The dominant Polish Workers' Party had a strictly pro-Soviet branch, led by Bierut and a number of [[Proletarian internationalism|internationalist]] in outlook Jewish communist activists, and a national branch, willing to take a \"Polish route to socialism\", led by Gomułka.<ref name=\"Czubiński historia Polski 229-233\"/><ref name=\"Czubiński historia Polski 238-240\"/>\n\nAs agreed by the Allies in Yalta, the Soviet Union incorporated the lands in eastern Poland ([[Kresy]], east of the Curzon Line), previously occupied and annexed in 1939 (see [[Territories of Poland annexed by the Soviet Union]]).<ref name=\"Czubiński historia Polski 220-222\"/> Deferring to Stalin's territorial schemes,{{Ref label|t|t|none}} the Allies compensated Poland with the German territories east of the [[Oder–Neisse line]], parts of  [[Pomerania]], [[Silesia]] and [[East Prussia]] (in Polish communist government's propaganda referred to as the [[Recovered Territories]]).<ref name=\"Kopp\"/>{{Ref label|m|m|none}} The deal was practically, but in principle not permanently, finalized at the [[Potsdam Conference]] (17 July to 2 August 1945).<ref name=\"Czubiński historia Polski 233-236\"/>{{Ref label|u|u|none}} The entire country was shifted to the west and resembled the territory of Medieval early [[History of Poland during the Piast dynasty|Piast Poland]].

From 1938, the growing external threat was clearly perceived by many and there were voices (mainly from the opposition) calling for the formation of a unified Government of National Defense and for taking other steps to promote a defense-minded consolidation of society. The Sanation ruling circle was not inclined to broaden the government's base and in June 1939 ultimately rejected any power-sharing ideas, apparently because they did not believe in the seriousness of German hostile intentions. The delegations that paid visits to President Mościcki and presented petitions on the issue of coalition government and general war preparedness, representing the agrarian and socialist parties and Polish intellectuals, were not well received. The regime did appeal to citizens' patriotism and generosity and several major fund raising efforts, often led by opposition groups and politicians (some of whom returned at that time of danger from political exile), resulted in donations of considerable magnitude, which by and large ended up not utilized.<ref name=\"Brzoza Sowa Historia Polski 1918–1945 365–367\"/>\n\n''q.''{{Note label|q|q|none}}In late February 1945, referring to the post-[[Yalta Conference]] protests of the [[Polish government-in-exile]], [[Winston Churchill]] said the following in the [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|House of Commons]]: \"Let me remind them that there would have been no [[Polish Committee of National Liberation|Lublin Committee]] or [[Provisional Government of the Republic of Poland|Lublin Provisional Government]] in Poland if the Polish Government in London had accepted our faithful counsel given to them a year ago.

Being highly antisemitic, they attacked [[Jewish partisans]] in German-occupied Poland. They fought the incoming Soviet troops and the Polish security forces. The [[Holy Cross Mountains Brigade]] of the NSZ avoided the Soviet advance and collaborated with the German military authorities, which made possible its entry into Czechoslovakia in February 1945. As the war ended, the brigade came in contact with the [[United States Army Central#World War II|US 3rd Army]]. The British refused to agree to the brigade's incorporation into the [[Polish Armed Forces in the West]] and the brigade was disarmed by the US Army in August.<ref name=\"Kochanski 520-527\"/><ref name=\"Czubiński druga wojna 218, 226\"/>\n\n''s.''{{Note label|s|s|none}}According to Andrzej Leon Sowa, between 10,000 and 25,000 civilians and 5,000 Polish soldiers perished during the siege and defense of Warsaw.<ref name=\"Brzoza Sowa Historia Polski 1918–1945 504–511\"/>\n\n''t.''{{Note label|t|t|none}}The size of post-war Poland was determined by [[Joseph Stalin]] alone, because the Western Allies, as shown by the record of British diplomacy, would not have objected to a much smaller Polish state being established.<ref name=\"Brzoza Sowa Historia Polski 1918–1945 512–521\"/>\n\n''u.''{{Note label|u|u|none}} The communist [[Provisional Government of the Republic of Poland|Provisional Government]] of Poland demanded the establishment of the post-war Polish-German border at the [[Oder–Neisse line]], that is along the [[Lusatian Neisse]] (Western Neisse), and, further north, the [[Oder]] river. [[Joseph Stalin]] indicated his support for the Polish position and the Provisional Government administered the region as soon as it was cleared of the German forces. The American and especially the British governments had a long-standing preference for the border to run further east in its southern portion, along the [[Nysa Kłodzka]] (Eastern Neisse) and the upper Oder rivers, which would keep a large portion of [[Lower Silesia]] and of the city of [[Wrocław|Breslau]] in post-war Germany. At the [[Potsdam Conference]], the delegation of what was now the Polish [[Provisional Government of National Unity]] continued lobbying aimed at keeping all of Lower Silesia under Polish jurisdiction, rather than letting some of it be a part of the [[Soviet occupation zone]] of Germany. Taking advantage of the British delegation's disruption by the results of the [[United Kingdom general election, 1945|British election]], the Americans engaged in dealing with the Soviets on their own. Its outcome, stated in the conference protocols, was that until the final peace settlement, the area all the way west to the Lusatian Neisse would by administered by Poland and not be a part of the Soviet zone of occupation. The planned peace conference never took place and the border has remained where it was provisionally placed in 1945. It was confirmed in the treaties that Poland signed with [[West Germany]] in 1970 and with [[unification of Germany|unified Germany]] in 1990.<ref name=\"Kochanski 537-541\"/>\n\n''v.''{{Note label|v|v|none}}The confiscations stopped after repeated appeals to [[Vyacheslav Molotov]] by [[Jakub Berman]] and [[Hilary Minc]].<ref name=\"Kochanski 541-545\"/>\n\n''w.''{{Note label|w|w|none}}There was a total of  1,517,983 'repatriates' from the east, according to Halik Kochanski.<ref name=\"Kochanski 545-552\"/> Others give different figures.
