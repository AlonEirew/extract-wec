The names were not used immediately and Kit Kat first appeared in the 1920s, when Rowntree's launched a brand of boxed chocolates entitled Kit Cat. This continued into the 1930s, when Rowntree's shifted focus and production onto its [[Black Magic (chocolates)|Black Magic]] and Dairy Box brands. With the promotion of alternative products the Kit Cat brand decreased and was eventually discontinued.<ref name=\"Kk1\">{{cite web|url=http://www.nestle.com/MediaCenter/NewsandFeatures/AllNewsFeatures/Happy-75th-birthday-KitKat.htm |title=Happy 75th birthday Kit Kat] Nestlé |accessdate=10 October 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101015224428/http://www.nestle.com/MediaCenter/NewsandFeatures/AllNewsFeatures/Happy-75th-birthday-KitKat.htm |archivedate=15 October 2010 }}</ref> The original four-finger bar was developed after a worker at Rowntree's York Factory put a suggestion in a recommendation box for a snack that \"a man could take to work in his pack\".<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.yorkpress.co.uk/news/8446094.KitKat___s_75th_anniversary_heralded/|title=KitKat's 75th anniversary heralded|newspaper=[[The Press]]|location=[[Christchurch]], [[New Zealand]]|publisher=[[Fairfax Media]]|date=12 October 2010|accessdate=4 May 2013}}</ref> The bar launched on 29 August 1935, under the title of Rowntree's Chocolate Crisp (priced at [[Old penny sterling|2d]]), and was sold in London and throughout Southern England.<ref name=\"professional\">{{cite web|title=The History of Kit Kat|url=http://www.nestleprofessional.com/uk/en/SiteArticles/Pages/History_of_KitKat.aspx|publisher=[[Nestlé]]|accessdate=4 May 2013}}</ref>\n\nThe product's official title of Rowntree's Chocolate Crisp was renamed Kit Kat Chocolate Crisp in 1937, the same year that Kit Kat began to incorporate \"Break\" into its recognisable advertising strategy.<ref name=\"Kk1\"/> The colour scheme and first flavour variation to the brand came in 1942, owing to [[World War II]], when food shortages prompted an alteration in the recipe. The flavour of Kit Kat was changed to \ndark chocolate; the packaging abandoned its Chocolate Crisp title, and was adorned in blue.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://popsop.com/39282 |title=Kit Kat Turns 75 |publisher=Popsop |location=[[Stevenage]], England |date=11 October 2010 |accessdate=4 May 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130620212415/http://popsop.com/39282 |archivedate=20 June 2013 }}</ref> After the war the title was altered to Kit Kat and resumed its original milk recipe and red packaging.\n\n[[File:KitKat.jpg|thumb|4-finger US Kit Kat|left]]\nFollowing on from its success in the United Kingdom, in the 1940s Kit Kat was exported to Canada, South Africa, Ireland, Australia, and New Zealand. In 1958, Donald Gilles, the executive at JWT Orland, created the iconic advertising line \"Have a Break, Have a Kit Kat\". The brand further expanded in the 1970s when Rowntree created a new distribution factory in Germany to meet European demand, and established agreements to distribute the brand in the USA and Japan through the Hershey and [[Fujiya Co.|Fujiya]] companies, respectively.<ref name=\"Kk1\"/> \n\nIn June 1988, Swiss company Nestlé acquired Kit Kat through the purchase of Rowntree's.

Nestlé, which has a substantial presence in the US, had to honour the licensing agreement when it bought Rowntree in 1988 which allowed Hershey to retain the Kit Kat licence so long as Hershey was not sold. As Kit Kat is one of Hershey's top five brands in the US market, the Kit Kat licence was a key factor in Hershey's failed attempt to attract a serious buyer in 2002.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.confectionerynews.com/Markets/Nestle-quiet-on-Hershey-sale|title=Nestlé quiet on Hershey sale|work=Confectionery News|publisher=[[William Reed Business Media]]|date=5 August 2002|accessdate=5 May 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|last=Sorkin|first=Andrew Ross|agency=[[New York Times]]|url=http://www.sfgate.com/default/article/Possible-buyers-seller-far-apart-on-Hershey-sale-2778035.php|title=Possible buyers, seller far apart on Hershey sale / Price and politics are obstacles|newspaper=[[San Francisco Chronicle]]|publisher=[[Hearst Corporation|Hearst Communications]]|location=San Francisco|date=27 August 2002|accessdate=4 May 2013}}</ref>\n\nVariants in the traditional chocolate bar first appeared in 1996 when Kit Kat Orange, the first flavour variant, was introduced in the United Kingdom. Its success was followed by several varieties including mint and caramel, and in 1999 Kit Kat Chunky was launched and received favourably by international consumers. Variations on the traditional Kit Kat have continued to develop throughout the 2000s. In 2000, Nestlé acquired Fujiya's share of the brand in Japan, and also expanded its marketplace in Japan, Russia, Turkey, and Venezuela, in addition to markets in Eastern and Central Europe.<ref name=\"Kk1\"/> Throughout the decade Kit Kat has introduced dozens of flavours and line extensions within specific consumer markets, and celebrated its 75th anniversary on 10 October 2009.{{Citation needed|date=October 2017}}\n\nThe traditional bar has four fingers which each measure approximately {{convert|1|cm|in|1}} by {{convert|9|cm|in|1}}. A two-finger bar was launched in the 1930s, and has remained the company's best-selling biscuit brand ever since.<ref name=\"professional\"/> The 1999 Kit Kat Chunky (known as Big Kat and Kit Kat Extra Crispy in the US) has one large finger approximately {{convert|2.5|cm|in|0}} wide. Kit Kat bars contain varying numbers of fingers depending on the market, ranging from the half-finger sized Kit Kat Petit in Japan, to the three-fingered variants in Arabia, to the twelve-finger family-size bars in Australia and France. Kit Kat bars are sold individually and in bags, boxes and multi-packs. In Ireland, France, the UK and America Nestlé also produces a Kit Kat [[ice cream]], and in Australia and Malaysia, Kit Kat [[Drumstick (ice cream)|Drumsticks]].{{Citation needed|date=October 2017}}\n\nIn 2010, a new £5&nbsp;million manufacturing line was opened by Nestlé in York.

Kit Kat bars in the United States are produced under licence by The Hershey Company, a Nestlé competitor, due to a prior licensing agreement with Rowntree.\nThe year 2003 was a turning point for the Kit Kat bar as well as the confectionery industry in general. The popularity of [[low carb]] diets and the push to healthier eating stifled sales growth in many parts of the world. In addition, fierce competition from [[Cadbury]]'s newly formed [[Cadbury Dairy Milk|Dairy Milk]] superbrand also contributed to sales of the Kit Kat decreasing considerably in its home market of the UK, and threatened to depose it from its No.1 position.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/business/3560857.stm|title=Fat profits: Choc tactics|work=[[BBC News]]|date=24 March 2004|accessdate=4 May 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/health/3315183.stm|title=Consumers 'snub unhealthy brands'|work=[[BBC News]]|publisher=[[BBC|British Broadcasting Corporation]]|location=London|date=13 December 2003|accessdate=4 May 2013}}</ref> The solution adopted by Nestlé and others was to increase dramatically the number of new and unique variations of their confections and market them as [[Special edition|limited or special editions]], whereby they would usually only be available for a few months at a time so as not to impact the sales of their permanent edition counterparts.<ref>{{cite news|last=Uhlig|first=Robert|url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/1454755/Cheesecake-Kit-Kat-Give-us-a-break.html|title=Cheesecake Kit Kat?

In 2002, Hershey Kit Kats adopted the slanted [[ellipse]] logo used worldwide by Nestlé, though the ellipse was red and the text white. The US version of \"Kit Kat Chunky\" is known as \"Big Kat\".\n\nIn the United Kingdom, the product has traditionally been wrapped in silver foil and an outer paper band. In 2001, [[flow wrap]] plastic was substituted as the confectionery's packaging.<ref>Suzy Bashford [http://www.marketingmagazine.co.uk/article/73773/brand-health-check-kit-kat---nestle-wise-repackage-kit-kat-kit-kat-shed-its-old-style-foil-paper-covering-flow-wrap-tear-strip-convince-consumers-right-move-asks-suzy-bashford \"BRAND HEALTH CHECK: Kit kat\"], ''Marketing'', 14 June 2001</ref>\n\nIn Norway, a similar product is manufactured by [[Mondelēz International]] and sold as [[Kvikk Lunsj]]; Kvikk Lunsj XXL is similar to a Kit Kat Chunky.\n\n==Marketing and promotion==\nAfter launching in the 1930s, Rowntree's Chocolate Crisp was originally advertised as \"the biggest little meal\" and \"the best companion to a cup of tea\". During World War II, Kit Kat was depicted as a valuable wartime foodstuff, with the slogan \"what active people need\". 'Kitty the Kat' arrived in the late 1940s to emphasise the \"rich full cream milk\" qualities of the bar and, thanks to contemporary improvements in production methods, also highlighted the new and improved 'snap' by responding to a biscuit being broken off screen. The first Kit Kat poster appeared in 1951, and the first colour TV advertisement appeared in 1969.\n\nSince 1958, the slogan for the Kit Kat in the UK and elsewhere has been \"Have a break... have a Kit Kat\". However, in 1995, Nestlé sought to trademark the \"Have a break\" portion. After a ten-year legal battle, which was contested by rival Mars, the [[European Court of Justice]] ruled on 7 July 2005 to send the case back to the [[Courts of the United Kingdom|British courts]].<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2005/07/07/business/worldbusiness/07iht-nestle.html?_r=0|title= Kit Kat slogan dispute sent back to U.K. courts|newspaper=[[International Herald Tribune]]|publisher=[[The New York Times Company]]|location=[[La Défense]], France|date=8 July 2005|accessdate=5 May 2013}}</ref> In 2004, Nestlé UK used the slogan \"Make the most of your break\",<ref>{{cite web|last=Marinovich|first=Slaven|url=http://www.brandchannel.com/features_profile.asp?pr_id=235|title=Kit Kat barred|work=Brand Channel|publisher=[[Interbrand]]|date=6 June 2005|accessdate=5 May 2013|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131203013655/http://www.brandchannel.com/features_profile.asp?pr_id=235|archivedate=3 December 2013|df=dmy-all}}</ref> but later returned to the original slogan.\n\nThe United States also used the short-lived slogan, \"Tastes So Good, You'll Roar\", in the early 1980s. The TV commercial most known from this slogan involves a young man biting into one of the Kit Kat bars in a grocery store, and roaring like a lion so loudly the whole store shakes violently, knocking items from the shelves. Another short-lived US slogan was \"That's What You Want\", whose television adverts showed people pulling unlikely foodstuffs from their pockets or purses, before rejecting them in favour of a Kit Kat.\n\nThe \"classic\" [[United States|American]] version of the \"Gimme a Break\" Kit Kat [[jingle]] (in use in the [[US]] since 1986) was written by [[Ken Shuldman]] (copy) and [[Michael A. Levine]] (music) for the [[DDB Worldwide|DDB Advertising Agency]]. Versions of the original have been covered by [[Carrie Underwood]], [[Shawn Colvin]], and many studio singers, as well as people who have appeared on-camera in the commercials. The jingle was cited in a study by [[University of Cincinnati]] researcher James J. Kellaris as one of the top ten \"[[earworm]]s\" – bits of melody that become stuck in your head. Another version of the advertising jingle 'Gimme a break' created for Kit Kat \"Factory\" commercial in the US was an original recording by [[Andrew W.K.]] W.K. was hired to write a new musical version for their \"Gimme a break\" slogan. Variations on the Andrew W.K. advertisement included executive dance routines in corporate offices and a network newsroom. However, the \"classic\" song has also been used again since the newer version first aired in 2004.\n\nA 1989 United Kingdom advertisement for Kit Kat, in which a zoo photographer \"takes a break\" from waiting for pandas to appear in an enclosure and misses them performing a dance routine, came in 30th in [[Channel 4]]'s \"100 Greatest Adverts\" poll in 2000.\n\nThe Maltese tour boat [[HMS Greetham (M2632)|MV ''Lady Davinia'']] had a distinctive red and white Kit Kat paint scheme before she sank in 2008.\n\nIn late 2004 through to the end of 2006, Nestlé Rowntree sponsored the English football club [[York City F.C.]]. As a result, the club's home-ground, [[Bootham Crescent]], was renamed to KitKat Crescent.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/wales/south_west/4352630.stm|title=City stadium takes sponsor's name|work=[[BBC News]]|publisher=[[BBC|British Broadcasting Corporation]]|location=London|date=18 October 2005|accessdate=5 May 2013}}</ref>\n\nIn an 2012 advertising campaign in the UK and Ireland, several new flavours of Chunky Kit Kat were marketed, with consumers being asked to vote for their favourite.
