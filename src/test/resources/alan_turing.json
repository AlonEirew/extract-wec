The headmistress recognised his talent early on, as did many of his subsequent teachers.\n\nBetween January 1922 and 1926, Turing was educated at Hazelhurst Preparatory School, an independent school in the village of [[Frant]] in Sussex (now [[East Sussex]]).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://oldshirburnian.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/TURING-Alan-Mathison.pdf|title=ALAN TURING ARCHIVE – SHERBORNE SCHOOL (ARCHON CODE: GB1949)|author=Alan Mathison|work=Sherborne School, Dorset|date=April 2016|accessdate=5 February 2017}}</ref> In 1926, at the age of 13, he went on to [[Sherborne School]], a boarding independent school in the market town of [[Sherborne]] in Dorset.

His headmaster wrote to his parents: \"I hope he will not fall between two stools. If he is to stay at public school, he must aim at becoming ''educated''. If he is to be solely a ''Scientific Specialist'', he is wasting his time at a public school\".<ref>{{Harvnb|Hodges|1983|p=26}}</ref> Despite this, Turing continued to show remarkable ability in the studies he loved, solving advanced problems in 1927 without having studied even elementary [[calculus]]. In 1928, aged 16, Turing encountered [[Albert Einstein]]'s work; not only did he grasp it, but it is possible that he managed to deduce Einstein's questioning of [[Newton's laws of motion]] from a text in which this was never made explicit.<ref>{{Harvnb|Hodges|1983|p=34}}</ref>\n\n===Christopher Morcom===\nAt Sherborne, Turing formed a significant friendship with fellow pupil Christopher Morcom, who has been described as Turing's \"first love\".

He coped with his grief by working that much harder on the topics of science and mathematics that he had shared with Morcom. In a letter to Morcom's mother Turing said:<blockquote>I am sure I could not have found anywhere another companion so brilliant and yet so charming and unconceited. I regarded my interest in my work, and in such things as astronomy (to which he introduced me) as something to be shared with him and I think he felt a little the same about me&nbsp;... I know I must put as much energy if not as much interest into my work as if he were alive, because that is what he would like me to do.<ref>{{Harvnb|Hodges|1983|p=61}}</ref></blockquote>\n\nSome have speculated that Morcom's death was the cause of Turing's [[atheism]] and [[materialism]].<ref>Paul Gray, [http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,990624,00.html Alan Turing] Time Magazine's Most Important People of the Century, p.2</ref> Apparently, at this point in his life he still believed in such concepts as a spirit, independent of the body and surviving death. In a later letter, also written to Morcom's mother, Turing said: <blockquote>Personally, I believe that spirit is really eternally connected with matter but certainly not by the same kind of body&nbsp;... as regards the actual connection between spirit and body I consider that the body [can] hold on to a 'spirit', whilst the body is alive and awake the two are firmly connected. When the body is asleep I cannot guess what happens but when the body dies, the 'mechanism' of the body, holding the spirit is gone and the spirit finds a new body sooner or later, perhaps immediately.<ref>{{Harvnb|Hodges|1983|pp=82–83}}</ref></blockquote>\n\n===University and work on computability===\nAfter Sherborne, Turing studied as an undergraduate from 1931 to 1934 at [[King's College, Cambridge]],<ref name=whoswho/> where he was awarded first-class honours in mathematics. In 1935, at the age of 22, he was elected a [[fellow]] of King's on the strength of a dissertation in which he proved the [[central limit theorem]].<ref>See Section 3 of John Aldrich, \"England and Continental Probability in the Inter-War Years\", Journal Electronique d'Histoire des Probabilités et de la Statistique, vol. 5/2 [http://www.jehps.net/decembre2009.html Decembre 2009] Journal Electronique d'Histoire des Probabilités et de la Statistique</ref> Unknown to the committee, the theorem had already been proven, in 1922, by [[Jarl Waldemar Lindeberg]].<ref>{{Harvnb|Hodges|1983|pp=88, 94}}</ref>\n\nIn 1936, Turing published his paper \"[[On Computable Numbers, with an Application to the Entscheidungsproblem]]\" (1936).<ref>{{Harvnb|Turing|1937}}</ref> In this paper, Turing reformulated [[Kurt Gödel]]'s 1931 results on the limits of proof and computation, replacing Gödel's universal arithmetic-based formal language with the formal and simple hypothetical devices that became known as [[Turing machine]]s. The ''[[Entscheidungsproblem]]'' (decision problem) was originally posed by German mathematician [[David Hilbert]] in 1928. Turing proved that his \"universal computing machine\" would be capable of performing any conceivable mathematical computation if it were representable as an [[algorithm]]. He went on to prove that there was no solution to the ''decision problem'' by first showing that the [[halting problem]] for Turing machines is [[Decision problem|undecidable]]: It is not possible to decide algorithmically whether a Turing machine will ever halt.\n\n[[File:20130808 Kings College Front Court Fountain Crop 03.jpg|thumb|right|[[King's College, Cambridge]], where Turing was a student in 1931 and became a Fellow in 1935. The computer room is named after him.]]\nAlthough [[Turing's proof]] was published shortly after [[Alonzo Church]]'s equivalent proof using his [[lambda calculus]],<ref>{{Harvnb|Church|1936}}</ref> Turing's approach is considerably more accessible and intuitive than Church's.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Grime|first1=James|title=What Did Turing Do for Us?|url=https://nrich.maths.org/8050|website=[[NRICH]]|publisher=[[University of Cambridge]]|accessdate=28 February 2016|date=February 2012}}</ref> It also included a notion of a 'Universal Machine' (now known as a [[universal Turing machine]]), with the idea that such a machine could perform the tasks of any other computation machine (as indeed could Church's lambda calculus). According to the [[Church–Turing thesis]], Turing machines and the lambda calculus are capable of computing anything that is computable. [[John von Neumann]] acknowledged that the central concept of the modern computer was due to Turing's paper.<ref>\"von Neumann&nbsp;... firmly emphasised to me, and to others I am sure, that the fundamental conception is owing to Turing—insofar as not anticipated by Babbage, Lovelace and others.\" Letter by [[Stanley Frankel]] to [[Brian Randell]], 1972, quoted in [[Jack Copeland]] (2004) ''The Essential Turing'', p.&nbsp;22.</ref> To this day, Turing machines are a central object of study in [[theory of computation]].\n\nFrom September 1936 to July 1938, Turing spent most of his time studying under Church at [[Princeton University]], in the second year as a [[Jane Eliza Procter Fellowship|Jane Eliza Procter Visiting Fellow]].

The bombe, with an enhancement suggested by mathematician [[Gordon Welchman]], became one of the primary tools, and the major automated one, used to attack Enigma-enciphered messages.\n\nJack Good opined:\n\n{{quote|Turing's most important contribution, I ''think'', was of part of the design of the bombe, the cryptanalytic machine.

For each possible setting of the rotors (which had on the order of 10<sup>19</sup> states, or 10<sup>22</sup> states for the four-rotor U-boat variant),<ref>Professor Jack Good in \"The Men Who Cracked Enigma\", 2003: with his caveat: \"if my memory is correct\".</ref> the bombe performed a chain of logical deductions based on the crib, implemented [[Electromechanics|electromechanically]].\n\nThe bombe detected when a contradiction had occurred and ruled out that setting, moving on to the next. Most of the possible settings would cause contradictions and be discarded, leaving only a few to be investigated in detail. A contradiction would occur when an enciphered letter would be turned back into the same plaintext letter—this simply wasn't possible with the Enigma. The first bombe was installed on 18 March 1940.<ref>{{Harvnb|Oakley|2006|p=40/03B}}</ref>\n\nBy late 1941, Turing and his fellow cryptanalysts Gordon Welchman, [[Conel Hugh O'Donel Alexander|Hugh Alexander]], and [[Stuart Milner-Barry]] were frustrated. Building on the [[Biuro Szyfrów#Gift to allies|work of the Poles]], they had set up a good working system for decrypting Enigma signals, but they only had a few people and a few bombes, so they did not have time to translate all the signals. In the summer, they had considerable success, and shipping losses had fallen to under 100,000 tons a month, but they were still on a knife-edge. They badly needed more resources to keep abreast of German adjustments. They had tried to get more people and fund more bombes through the proper channels, but they were getting nowhere. Finally, breaking all the rules, on 28 October they wrote directly to [[Winston Churchill]] spelling out their difficulties, with Turing as the first named.

For example, if a catalyst A is required for a certain chemical reaction to take place, and if the reaction produced more of the catalyst A, then we say that the reaction is [[autocatalytic]], and there is positive feedback that can be modelled by nonlinear differential equations. Turing discovered that patterns could be created if the chemical reaction not only produced catalyst A, but also produced an inhibitor B that slowed down the production of A. If A and B then diffused through the container at different rates, then you could have some regions where A dominated and some where B did. To calculate the extent of this, Turing would have needed a powerful computer, but these were not so freely available in 1951, so he had to use linear approximations to solve the equations by hand. Fortunately these calculations gave the right qualitative results, and produced, for example, a uniform mixture that oddly enough had regularly spaced fixed red spots. The Russian biochemist [[Boris Pavlovich Belousov|Boris Belousov]] had performed experiments with similar results, but could not get his papers published because of the contemporary prejudice that any such thing violated the [[second law of thermodynamics]].

He suggests an alternative explanation for the cause of Turing's death, this being the accidental inhalation of cyanide fumes from an apparatus for [[electroplating]] gold onto spoons, which uses potassium cyanide to [[Gold#Commercial chemistry|dissolve the gold]].  Turing had such an apparatus set up in his tiny spare room. Copeland notes that the autopsy findings were more consistent with inhalation than with ingestion of the poison.

It was published in 1959, and so could not cover his war work. Scarcely 300 copies were sold (Sara Turing to Lyn Newman, 1967, Library of [[St John's College, Cambridge]]). The six-page foreword by [[Lyn Irvine]] includes reminiscences and is more frequently quoted. It was re-published by Cambridge University Press in 2012, to honour the centenary of his birth, and included a new foreword by [[Martin Davis]], as well as a never-before-published memoir by Turing's older brother John F.
