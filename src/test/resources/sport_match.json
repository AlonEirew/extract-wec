The final was contested by [[Germany national football team|Germany]] and [[Brazil national football team|Brazil]]. It was the first World Cup meeting between the two sides. Brazil won the match 2–0, winning a record fifth title. [[Ronaldo (Brazilian footballer)|Ronaldo]], who became the record World Cup goalscorer at the [[2006 FIFA World Cup|2006 tournament]], scored two of his fifteen World Cup goals in the second half of the match, leading Brazil to the title and winning the [[World Cup Golden Boot|Golden Boot]] award. It also marked Brazilian captain [[Cafu]]'s third consecutive appearance in a World Cup Final, a feat that has yet to be accomplished by any other player in the history of the tournament. Both teams had won their respective groups before advancing to the [[2002 FIFA World Cup knockout stage|knockout stage]], where Germany shut out all of their opponents to reach the final, while Brazil only allowed a single goal from [[England national football team|England]]. Germany overcame [[United States men's national soccer team|United States]] and co-host [[South Korea national football team|South Korea]], while Brazil knocked out England and Turkey.\n\nThe title marked Brazil's fifth World Cup championship, which is more than any other nation has achieved, also being the first team to win all seven of their games without any extra time or penalty kicks. Brazil also became the first nation to win the World Cup outside Europe and the Americas. Germany lost the World Cup Final for its fourth time, another tournament record. They were attempting to equal Brazil for most World Cup wins, as they already had three.\n\nAs of [[2014 FIFA World Cup|2014]] this was the last World Cup final that ended in regulation time. It is also the most recent World Cup won by a South American team.\n\n==Route to the final==\n{|  style=\"width:100%; text-align:center;\"\n|-  style=\"vertical-align:top; background:#9cf;\"\n!colspan=2 style=\"width:1*\"|Germany\n!Round\n!colspan=2 style=\"width:1*\"|Brazil\n\n|-  style=\"vertical-align:top; background:#c1e0ff;\"\n|Opponent\n|Result\n||[[2002 FIFA World Cup#First round|First round]]\n|Opponent\n|Result\n|-\n|{{fb|KSA}}\n|[[2002 FIFA World Cup Group E#Germany vs Saudi Arabia|8–0]]\n| style=\"background:#c1e0ff;\"|Match 1\n|{{fb|TUR}}\n|[[2002 FIFA World Cup Group C#Brazil vs Turkey|2–1]]\n|-\n|{{fb|IRL}}\n|[[2002 FIFA World Cup Group E#Germany vs Republic of Ireland|1–1]]\n| style=\"background:#c1e0ff;\"|Match 2\n|{{fb|CHN}}\n|[[2002 FIFA World Cup Group C#Brazil vs China PR|4–0]]\n|-\n|{{fb|CMR}}\n|[[2002 FIFA World Cup Group E#Cameroon vs Germany|2–0]]\n| style=\"background:#c1e0ff;\"|Match 3\n|{{fb|CRC}}\n|[[2002 FIFA World Cup Group C#Costa Rica vs Brazil|5–2]]\n\n|-\n| colspan=\"2\" style=\"text-align:center;\"|\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" align=\"right\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|-\n!width=\"185\"|Team\n!width=\"20\"|Pld\n!width=\"20\"|W\n!width=\"20\"|D\n!width=\"20\"|L\n!width=\"20\"|GF\n!width=\"20\"|GA\n!width=\"20\"|GD\n!width=\"20\"|Pts\n|- bgcolor=\"#ccffcc\"\n|align=\"left\"|'''{{fb|GER}}'''\n|3||2||1||0||11||1||+10||'''7'''\n|- bgcolor=\"#ccffcc\"\n|align=\"left\"|{{fb|IRL}}\n|3||1||2||0||5||2||+3||'''5'''\n|-\n|align=\"left\"|{{fb|CMR}}\n|3||1||1||1||2||3||&minus;1||'''4'''\n|-\n|align=\"left\"|{{fb|KSA}}\n|3||0||0||3||0||12||&minus;12||'''0'''\n|}\n|style=\"background:#c1e0ff\"|Final standings\n|colspan=\"2\" style=\"text-align:center\"|\n{| class=\"wikitable\" align=\"right\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|-\n!width=\"185\"|Team\n!width=\"20\"|Pld\n!width=\"20\"|W\n!width=\"20\"|D\n!width=\"20\"|L\n!width=\"20\"|GF\n!width=\"20\"|GA\n!width=\"20\"|GD\n!width=\"20\"|Pts\n|- bgcolor=\"#ccffcc\"\n|align=\"left\"|'''{{fb|BRA}}'''\n|3||3||0||0||11||3||+8||'''9'''\n|- bgcolor=\"#ccffcc\"\n|align=\"left\"|{{fb|TUR}}\n|3||1||1||1||5||3||+2||'''4'''\n|-\n|align=\"left\"|{{fb|CRC}}\n|3||1||1||1||5||6||&minus;1||'''4'''\n|-\n|align=\"left\"|{{fb|CHN}}\n|3||0||0||3||0||9||&minus;9||'''0'''\n|}\n|-  style=\"vertical-align:top; background:#c1e0ff;\"\n|Opponent\n|Result\n||[[2002 FIFA World Cup knockout stage|Knockout stage]]\n|Opponent\n|Result\n|-\n|{{fb|PAR}}\n|[[2002 FIFA World Cup knockout stage#Germany vs Paraguay|1–0]]\n| style=\"background:#c1e0ff;\"|Round of 16\n|{{fb|BEL}}\n|[[2002 FIFA World Cup knockout stage#Brazil vs Belgium|2–0]]\n|-\n|{{fb|USA}}\n|[[2002 FIFA World Cup knockout stage#Germany vs United States|1–0]]\n| style=\"background:#c1e0ff;\"|Quarter-finals\n|{{fb|ENG}}\n|[[2002 FIFA World Cup knockout stage#England vs Brazil|2–1]]\n|-\n|{{fb|KOR}}\n|[[2002 FIFA World Cup knockout stage#Germany vs South Korea|1–0]]\n| style=\"background:#c1e0ff;\"|Semifinals\n|{{fb|TUR}}\n|[[2002 FIFA World Cup knockout stage#Brazil vs Turkey|1–0]]\n|}\n\n===Germany===\n{{further|2002 FIFA World Cup Group E}}\nPrior to the tournament, Germany were plagued by a series of injuries to key players.
