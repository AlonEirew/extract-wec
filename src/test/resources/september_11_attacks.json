The CIA never responded.{{sfn|Wright|2006|p=340}}\n\nThe same day in July, Margarette Gillespie, an FBI analyst working in the CTC, was told to review material about the Malaysia meeting. She was not told of the participants' presence in the U.S. The CIA gave Gillespie surveillance photos of Mihdhar and Hazmi from the meeting to show to FBI counterterrorism, but did not tell her their significance. The Intelink database informed her not to share intelligence material on the meeting to criminal investigators. When shown the photos, the FBI were refused more details on their significance, and also did not receive Mihdhar's date of birth or passport number.{{sfn|Wright|2006|pp=340–343}} In late August 2001, Gillespie told the [[Immigration and Naturalization Service|INS]], the State Department, the [[United States Customs Service|Customs Service]], and the FBI to put Hazmi and Mihdhar on their watchlists, but the FBI was prohibited from using criminal agents in the search for the duo, which hindered their efforts.{{sfn|Wright|2006|pp=352–353}}\n\nAlso in July, a [[Phoenix, Arizona|Phoenix]]-based FBI agent sent a message to FBI headquarters, Alec Station, and to FBI agents in New York, alerting them to \"the possibility of a coordinated effort by Osama bin Laden to send students to the United States to attend civil aviation universities and colleges.\" The agent, Kenneth Williams, suggested the need to interview all flight school managers and identify all Arab students seeking flight training.{{sfn|Wright|2006|p=350}} In July, Jordan alerted the U.S. that al-Qaeda was planning an attack on the U.S.; \"months later\", Jordan notified the U.S. that the attack's codename was \"The Big Wedding\", and that it involved airplanes.{{sfn|Yitzhak|2016|p=218}}\n\nOn August 6, the CIA's Presidential Daily Brief, designated \"For the President Only\", was entitled [[Bin Ladin Determined To Strike in US|\"Bin Ladin Determined to Strike in U.S.\"]] The memo noted that \"The FBI information... indicates patterns of suspicious activity in this country consistent with preparations for hijackings or other types of attacks.\"<ref>{{cite web|title=THE OSAMA BIN LADEN FILE: National Security Archive Electronic Briefing Book No. 343|url=http://nsarchive.gwu.edu/NSAEBB/NSAEBB343/|website=The National Security Archive|publisher=The National Security Archive|accessdate=March 14, 2016}}</ref>\n\nIn mid-August, one [[Minnesota]] flight school alerted the FBI to [[Zacarias Moussaoui]], who had asked \"suspicious questions.\" The FBI found that he was a radical who had traveled to Pakistan, and the INS arrested him for overstaying his [[France|French]] visa. Their request to search his laptop was denied by FBI headquarters due to the lack of [[probable cause]].{{sfn|Wright|2006|pp=350–351}}\n\nThe failures in intelligence-sharing were attributed to 1995 [[United States Department of Justice|Justice Department]] policies limiting intelligence sharing, combined with CIA and NSA reluctance in revealing \"sensitive sources and methods\" such as tapped phones.{{sfn|Wright|2006|pp=342–343}} Testifying before the [[9/11 Commission]] in April 2004, then-[[Attorney General]] [[John Ashcroft]] recalled that the \"single greatest structural cause for the September 11th problem was the wall that segregated or separated criminal investigators and intelligence agents.\"{{sfn|Javorsek II|Rose|Marshall|Leitner|2015|p=742}} Clarke also wrote that \"There were failures in the organizations... failures to get information to the right place at the right time...\"{{sfn|Clarke|2004|p=238}}\n\n==Attacks==\n{{Further|Timeline for the day of the September 11 attacks}}\n\n[[File:Flight paths of hijacked planes-September 11 attacks.jpg|thumb|upright=1.3|Flight paths of the four planes used on September 11]]\n\nEarly on the morning of September 11, 2001, [[Hijackers in the September 11 attacks|19 hijackers]] took control of four commercial airliners (two [[Boeing 757]] and two [[Boeing 767]]) en route to California (three headed to [[Los Angeles International Airport|LAX]] in [[Los Angeles]], and one to [[San Francisco International Airport|SFO]] in [[San Francisco]]) after takeoffs from [[Logan International Airport]] in [[Boston]], [[Massachusetts]]; [[Newark Liberty International Airport]] in [[Newark, New Jersey]]; and [[Washington Dulles International Airport]] in [[Loudoun County, Virginia|Loudoun]] and [[Fairfax County, Virginia|Fairfax]] counties in [[Virginia]].<ref name=\"911-ch1\" /> Large planes with long flights were selected for hijacking because they would be heavily fueled.<ref name=\"Chap7\" /><!--weren't early morning flights also chosen because they would have fewer passengers to overcome?-->\n\nThe four flights were:\n* [[American Airlines Flight 11]]: a Boeing 767 aircraft, departed Logan Airport at 7:59&nbsp;a.m. en route to Los Angeles with a crew of 11 and 76 passengers, not including five hijackers.
