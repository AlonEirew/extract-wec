Each of these [[megathrust earthquake]]s also spawned tsunamis in the Pacific Ocean. However, the death toll from these was significantly lower, primarily because of the lower population density along the coasts near affected areas and the much greater distances to more populated coasts and also due to the superior infrastructure and warning systems in MEDCs (More Economically Developed Countries) such as Japan.\n\nOther very large [[megathrust earthquake]]s occurred in 1868 ([[Peru]], [[Nazca Plate]] and [[South American Plate]]); 1827 ([[Colombia]], Nazca Plate and South American Plate); 1812 ([[Venezuela]], [[Caribbean Plate]] and South American Plate) and [[1700 Cascadia earthquake|1700]] (western North America, [[Juan de Fuca Plate]] and [[North American Plate]]).

An estimated {{convert|1600|km|mi|-2}} of [[Fault (geology)|fault surface]] slipped (or ruptured) about {{convert|15|m|ft|-1}} along the [[subduction]] zone where the [[Indian Plate]] slides (or subducts) under the overriding [[Burma Plate]]. The slip did not happen instantaneously but took place in two phases over a period of several minutes:\nSeismographic and acoustic data indicate that the first phase involved a rupture about {{convert|400|km|mi|-1}} long and {{convert|100|km|mi|-1}} wide, located {{convert|30|km|mi}} beneath the sea bed—the largest rupture ever known to have been caused by an earthquake. The rupture proceeded at a speed of about {{convert|2.8|km/s|abbr=off}} ({{convert|10000|km/h|mi/h|disp=or|abbr=on}}), beginning off the coast of [[Aceh]] and proceeding north-westerly over a period of about 100&nbsp;seconds.\nA pause of about another 100&nbsp;seconds took place before the rupture continued northwards towards the [[Andaman Islands|Andaman]] and [[Nicobar Islands]]. However, the northern rupture occurred more slowly than in the south, at about {{convert|2.1|km/s|abbr=on}} ({{convert|7500|km/h|disp=or|abbr=on}}), continuing north for another five minutes to a plate boundary where the fault type changes from subduction to [[Strike-slip fault|strike-slip]] (the two plates slide past one another in opposite directions).\n\nThe [[Indian Plate]] is part of the great [[Indo-Australian Plate]], which underlies the Indian Ocean and [[Bay of Bengal]], and is drifting north-east at an average of 6 centimetres per year ({{convert|6|cm|in|disp=output number only}} inches per year). The India Plate meets the [[Burma Plate]] (which is considered a portion of the great [[Eurasian Plate]]) at the [[Sunda Trench]]. At this point the India Plate subducts beneath the Burma Plate, which carries the [[Nicobar Islands]], the [[Andaman Islands]], and northern [[Sumatra]]. The India Plate sinks deeper and deeper beneath the Burma Plate until the increasing temperature and pressure drive [[volatiles]] out of the subducting plate. These volatiles rise into the overlying plate causing [[partial melting]] and the formation of [[magma]]. The rising magma intrudes into the crust above and exits the [[Earth]]'s crust through [[volcano]]es in the form of a [[volcanic arc]]. The volcanic activity that results as the Indo-Australian Plate subducts the [[Eurasian Plate]] has created the [[Sunda Arc]].\n\nAs well as the sideways movement between the plates, the [[sea floor]] is estimated to have risen by several metres, displacing an estimated {{convert|30|km3|cumi}} of water and triggering devastating [[tsunami]] waves. The waves did not originate from a [[point source]], as was inaccurately depicted in some illustrations of their paths of travel, but rather radiated outwards along the entire {{convert|1600|km|mi|-2|adj=on}} length of the rupture (acting as a [[line source]]). This greatly increased the geographical area over which the waves were observed, reaching as far as Mexico, Chile, and the Arctic. The raising of the sea floor significantly reduced the capacity of the Indian Ocean, producing a permanent rise in the global sea level by an estimated {{convert|0.1|mm|sigfig=1}}.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Bilham|first1=Roger|title=A Flying Start, Then a Slow Slip|journal=[[Science (journal)|Science]]|date=20 May 2005|volume=308|issue=5725|pages=1126–1127|doi=10.1126/science.1113363|bibcode=2005Sci...308.1126B}}</ref>\n\n===Aftershocks and other earthquakes===\n[[File:Neic slav fig72.gif|thumb|250px|Locations of initial earthquake and all aftershocks measuring greater than 4.0 from 26 December 2004 to 10 January 2005.

Setting up the communications infrastructure to issue timely warnings is an even bigger problem, particularly in a relatively poor part of the world.\n\nTsunamis are much more frequent in the [[Pacific Ocean]] because of earthquakes in the \"[[Ring of Fire]]\", and an effective tsunami warning system has long been in place there. Although the extreme western edge of the Ring of Fire extends into the Indian Ocean (the point where the earthquake struck), no warning system exists in that ocean. Tsunamis there are relatively rare despite earthquakes being relatively frequent in Indonesia. The last major tsunami was caused by the [[Krakatoa]] eruption of 1883. It should be noted that not every earthquake produces large tsunamis; on 28 March 2005, a magnitude 8.7 earthquake hit roughly the same area of the Indian Ocean but did not result in a major tsunami.\n\nThe first warning sign of a possible tsunami is the earthquake itself. However, tsunamis can strike thousands of kilometres away where the earthquake is only felt weakly or not at all. Also, in the minutes preceding a tsunami strike, the sea often recedes temporarily from the coast, which was observed on the eastern side of the rupture zone of the earthquake such as around the coastlines of [[Aceh]] province, [[Phuket]] island and [[Khao Lak]] area in Thailand, [[Penang]] island of Malaysia and the [[Andaman and Nicobar islands]].

Inundation has been observed, along east coast of South Andaman Island and is found to be restricted at Chidiyatapu, Burmanallah, Kodiaghat, Beadnabad, Corbyn’s cove and Marina Park/Aberdeen Jetty areas. Along the west coast, the inundation has been observed around Guptapara, Manjeri, Wandoor, Collinpur and Tirur regions. Several near shore establishments and numerous infrastructures such as seawalls and a 20 MW diesel generated power plant at Bamboo Flat were extensively damaged.<ref name=Ghosh/>\n\nResults of the tsunami survey in South Andaman along Chiriyatapu, Corbyn’s Cove and Wandoor beaches:\n\n* 5.0&nbsp;m (16.4&nbsp;ft) in maximum tsunami height with a run-up of 4.24&nbsp;m (13.9&nbsp;ft) at Chiriyatapu Beach.\n* 5.48&nbsp;m (18&nbsp;ft) in maximum tsunami height and run-up at Corbyn's Cove Beach.\n* 6.64&nbsp;m (21.8&nbsp;ft) in maximum tsunami height and run-up of 4.63&nbsp;m (15.2&nbsp;ft) at Wandoor Beach.\n\nMeanwhile, in the Little Andaman, tsunami waves impinged on the eastern shore of this island 25 to 30 minutes after the earthquake. It was a four-wave cycle; out of which the fourth one was most devastating with a tsunami wave height of about 10&nbsp;m (33&nbsp;ft). The tsunami water had converted the settlements at Hut Bay into rubbles within a range of 1&nbsp;km inland from the seashore. Everything was destroyed including the jetty and the breakwater. Run up level up to 3.3&nbsp;m (10.8&nbsp;ft) have been measured.<ref name=Ghosh/>\n\nMoreover, in Malacca located on the island of Car Nicobar, According to local people, three pulses of tsunami waves attacked the area three times. The first wave that came 5 minutes after the earthquake was preceded by recession of the seawater up to 600–700 m (1969–2297&nbsp;ft), exposing the seabed. The second and third waves came with a 10 minutes interval after the first and second waves respectively. The third wave was the strongest, with a maximum tsunami wave height of 11&nbsp;m (36&nbsp;ft) and was accompanied by a loud noise. The landward flow direction measured from bent rods was towards S800 W and the back flow was towards east direction. The inundation limit is 1.125&nbsp;m (0.41&nbsp;ft) from the sea water/land contact (on the date of measurement) towards west and restricted up to 10 m.<ref name=Ghosh/> Furthermore, waves nearly 3 stories high devastated the Indian Air Force base, located just south of Malacca. The tsunami waves attacked the area three times with a maximum tsunami wave height of 11&nbsp;m (36&nbsp;ft). Inundation limit was found to be up to 1.25&nbsp;km (4101&nbsp;ft) inland. The impact of the waves was so severe that four Oil tankers of IOC were thrown almost 800&nbsp;m (2624&nbsp;ft) from the seashore near Malacca to Air force colony main gate.<ref name=Ghosh/> In Chuckchucha and Lapati, the tsunami arrived in a three wave cycle with a maximum tsunami wave height of 12&nbsp;m (39&nbsp;ft).\n\nIn Campbell Bay of Great Nicobar island, the tsunami waves hit the area three times with an inundation limit of 250–550 m (820–1804&nbsp;ft). The first wave came within 5 minutes of the earthquake. The second and third waves came 10 minutes after first and second waves respectively. The second wave was the strongest with a loud noise. Deadly tsunami waves wreaked havoc in this densely populated Jogindar Nagar area, situated 13&nbsp;km south of Campbell Bay. According to local information, tsunami waves attacked the area thrice. The first wave came 5 minutes after the main shock (0629 hrs.) with a marginal drop in sea level. Second wave came 10 minutes after the first one with a maximum height of 4.84&nbsp;m (15.9&nbsp;ft) and caused the major destruction. The third wave came within 15 minutes after the second one with a lower wave height. The maximum inundation limit due to tsunami water intrusion has been found to be about 500 m (0.5&nbsp;km).<ref name=Ghosh/>\n\nThe worst affected island in the Andaman & Nicobar chain is Katchall Island with 303 people confirmed dead and 4,354 missing out of a total population of 5,312.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://iset.org.in/pdf/souvenir%20&%20abstract%20volume/37-41.pdf|title=Damage to Andaman & Nicobar Islands due to Earthquake and Tsunami of Dec. 26, 2004|last1=Paul|first1=D.K.|last2=Singh|first2=Yogendra|last3=Dubey|first3=R.N.|publisher=Department of Earthquake Engineering, IIT Roorkee|accessdate=20 December 2016}}</ref><ref name=\"andamanconnections.com\">{{cite web|url=http://andamanconnections.com/andaman_tsunami.html|title=Tsunami in Andaman & Nicobar Islands|work=Andamanconnections.com|accessdate=20 December 2016}}</ref><ref name=\"istructe.org\">{{cite book|url=https://www.istructe.org/downloads/resources-centre/technical-topic-area/eefit/eefit-reports/indian-ccean-tsunami.pdf|title=The Indian Ocean Tsunami of 26 December 2004: Mission Findings in Sri Lanka and Thailand|first1=Antonios|last1=Pomonis|first2=Tiziana|last2=Rossetto|first3=Navin|last3=Peiris|first4=Sean|last4=Wilkinson|first5=Domenico|last5=Del Re|first6=Raymond|last6=Koo|first7=Raul|last7=Manlapig|first8=Stewart|last8=Gallocher|publisher=Earthquake Engineering Field Investigation Team, Institution of Structural Engineers|place=London|date=February 2006|isbn=0-901297-41-0}}</ref>\n\nEyewitnesses at [[Port Blair]] recall that the water receded before the first wave, and the third wave was the tallest and caused the most damage.

Tourism and fishing industries created high population densities along the coast.<ref name=\"ReferenceC\">{{cite web|url=http://academic.evergreen.edu/g/grossmaz/HELGESTJ/|title=Tsunami – Tsunami Disaster in Sri Lanka|publisher=}}</ref>\n\nThe coastal lifestyle of people and degradation of the natural environment in Sri Lanka contributed to the high death tolls. In addition to the high number of fatalities, approximately 90,000 buildings were destroyed. Houses were easily destroyed since they were built mostly from wood.<ref name=\"ReferenceC\"/>\n\n===Thailand===\nThe tsunami hit the southwest coast of southern [[Thailand]], which was about 500&nbsp;km (310.69 miles) from the epicenter. The region is prominent with tourists internationally. Since the tsunami hit during high tide, its damage was severe. Approximately 5,400 people were killed and 3,100 people were reported missing in Thailand. The places where the tsunami struck were Khao Lak, Phuket Island, the [[Phi Phi Islands]], Koh Racha Yai, Koh Lanta Yai and Ao Nang of [[Krabi province]], offshore archipelagos like the [[Surin Islands]], the [[Similan Islands]], and coastal areas of [[Satun]], [[Ranong]], [[Phang Nga]], [[Trang, Thailand|Trang]] and [[Krabi]] provinces.\n\nThe country experienced the largest tsunami runup height of any location outside of [[Sumatra]], which occurred at [[Khao Lak]] and the areas of Takua Pa district that are facing the Andaman Sea. The tsunami heights recorded:<ref name=\"ReferenceB\"/><ref name=\"marine.tmd.go.th\">http://www.marine.tmd.go.th/Presentation/Alexandria/The%202004%20Indian%20tsunami%20in%20Thailand%20Surveyed%20runup%20heights%20and%20tide%20gauge%20records.pdf</ref>\n\n* 6–10 m (19.7&nbsp;ft–32.8&nbsp;ft) in Khao Lak.\n* 3–6 m (9.84&nbsp;ft–19.7&nbsp;ft) along the west coast of Phuket island.\n* 3&nbsp;m (9.84&nbsp;ft) along the south coast of Phuket island.\n* 2&nbsp;m (6.56&nbsp;ft) along the east coast of Phuket island.\n* 4–6 m (13.12&nbsp;ft–19.7&nbsp;ft) on the Phi Phi Islands.\n* 19.6&nbsp;m (64.3&nbsp;ft) at Ban Thung Dap.\n* 5&nbsp;m (16.4&nbsp;ft) at Ramson.\n* 6.8&nbsp;m (22.3&nbsp;ft) at Ban Thale Nok.\n* 5&nbsp;m (16.4&nbsp;ft) at Hat Praphat (Ranong Coastal Resources Research Station).\n* 6.3&nbsp;m (20.7&nbsp;ft) at Thai Muang district.\n* 6.8&nbsp;m (22.3&nbsp;ft) at Rai Dan.\n\nThe province of Phang-Nga was the most heavily affected area in Thailand by the gigantic tsunami. The northern part of Phang-Nga Province is a rural area with fishery and agricultural villages while the central part has several resort hotels. Khao Lak is located in the south of Phang-Nga Province with many luxurious hotels, popular to foreign tourists, especially from [[Europe]]. Khao Lak was hit by the gigantic tsunami after 10:00&nbsp;a.m. and the death toll in the area was the largest in Thailand.<ref>http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.564.5976&rep=rep1&type=pdf</ref> Many local villagers and tourists lost their lives during the event. A maximum inundation of approximately 2&nbsp;km (1.2 miles) and the inundated depths were 4–7 m (13.12&nbsp;ft–23&nbsp;ft) in Khao Lak. Surveys conducted show that the tsunami inundated the third floor of a resort hotel. The tsunami heights in Khao Lak were much higher than Phuket Island. The reason for the difference seems to have been caused by the local [[bathymetry]] off Khao Lak. According to some interviews with local residents and affected tourists, the leading wave produced an initial depression, called a tsunami drawback or 'disappearing sea' effect and the second wave was largest.<ref name=\"ReferenceB\">http://www.tsunami.civil.tohoku.ac.jp/sumatra2004/C4.pdf</ref>\nThe highest recorded tsunami runup measured was at 19.6&nbsp;m (64.3&nbsp;ft) at Ban Thung Dap, located on the southwest tip of [[Ko Phra Thong|Ko Phra Thong Island]] and the second highest at 15.8&nbsp;m (51.8&nbsp;ft) at Ban Nam Kim.<ref name=\"marine.tmd.go.th\"/>\n[[File:Khao Lak Police Boat 813.jpg|thumbnail|Thai navy boat 813 (police boat) stranded almost 2 km inland by the [[Khao Lak]] tsunami.]]\n\nAt Phuket island, many of its west coast beaches were affected. At [[Patong Beach]] – a tourist mecca – the tsunami heights were 5–6 m (16.4&nbsp;ft–19.7&nbsp;ft) and the inundated depth was about 2&nbsp;m (6.6&nbsp;ft). The tsunami heights became lower from the west coast, the south coast to the east coast of the island. On Karon beach on the west coast, the coastal road was built higher than the shore and it acted as a seawall, protecting a hotel which was behind it. On the east coast of Phuket Island, which was not facing the tsunami source, the tsunami height was about 2&nbsp;m (6.6&nbsp;ft). In one river mouth, many boats were damaged. The tsunami propagated anticlockwise around Phuket Island, as was the case at [[Okushiri Island]] in the [[1993 Hokkaido earthquake]]. According to some interviews with the people, the leading wave produced an initial depression and the second wave was the largest.<ref name=\"ReferenceB\"/>\n\n[[File:Tsunami Phuket.jpg|thumbnail|Tsunami wave striking Phuket coast.]]\n\nThe [[Phi Phi Islands]] are a group of small [[islands]] that were affected by the tsunami. The north bay of Phi Phi Don Island opens to the northwest, thus it faced in the direction that the tsunami came from. The measured tsunami height on this [[beach]] was 5.8&nbsp;m (19.02&nbsp;ft). According to some eyewitnesses accounts, the [[tsunami]] came from the north and south, and totally washed the central area away. The ground level here was about 2&nbsp;m (6.6&nbsp;ft) above sea level, but there were many cottages and hotels. Therefore, the tsunami waves from the north and south destroyed the area, the south bay opens to the southeast. It faces in the opposite direction to which the tsunami was propagated. Further, Phi Phi Le Island shields the port of Phi Phi Don Island. The measured tsunami height, however, was 4.6&nbsp;m (15.1&nbsp;ft) in the port. It indicated that the tsunami propagated around the islands.<ref name=\"ReferenceB\"/>\n\nMany amateur videos recorded by tourists and locals of the tsunami at Thailand were televised popularly in the media.\n\n=== Mainland India===\nThe tsunami arrived in the states of [[Andhra Pradesh]] and [[Tamil Nadu]] along the southeast coast of the Indian mainland shortly after 9:00&nbsp;a.m. At least two hours later, it arrived in the state of [[Kerala]] along the southwest coast. Tamil Nadu, the union territory of [[Pondicherry]] and Kerala were extensively damaged, while Andhra Pradesh sustained moderate damage. There were two to five [[water waves|waves]] of varying [[height]] that coincided with the local high tide in some areas.<ref name=\"mapsofindia.com\">{{cite web|url=http://www.mapsofindia.com/maps/tsunami-in-india/tsunami-affected-area-india.html|title=Tsunami Affected Areas in India 2004|publisher=}}</ref><ref>http://academic.evergreen.edu/g/grossmaz/cramerbd/%3E</ref><ref name=\"books.google.com.my\">{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=fICXQSPJwx8C|title=Natural and Anthropogenic Disasters: Vulnerability, Preparedness and Mitigation|first=M.

The inundation distance varied with topology and vegetation. Areas with dense [[coconut]] groves or [[mangroves]] had much smaller inundation distances, and those with [[river]] mouths or backwaters saw much larger inundation distances.{{citation needed|date=June 2016}}Presence of seawalls at the [[Kerala]] coast and some of Tamil Nadu coast helped to reduce the impact of the waves. However, when the seawalls were made of loose stones, the stones were displaced and carried a few metres inland.<ref name=\"mapsofindia.com\"/><ref name=\"books.google.com.my\"/><ref name=\"academic.evergreen.edu\"/>\n\nThe state of [[Kerala]] experienced tsunami-related damage in three southern districts, [[Ernakulam]], [[Alappuzha]], and [[Kollam]], which are densely populated with villagers, due to diffraction of the waves around [[Sri Lanka]]. The southernmost district of [[Thiruvananthpuram]], however, escaped damage, possibly due to the wide turn of the diffracted waves at the peninsular tip. Major damage occurred in two narrow strips of land bound on the west by the [[Arabian Sea]] and on the east by a network of [[Backwater (river)|backwaters]] – [[Kerala backwaters]]. The waves receded before the first tsunami with the highest fatality reported from the densely populated Alappad panchayat (including the villages of Cheriya Azhikkal and Azhikkal) at Kollam district, caused by a 4&nbsp;m (13.1&nbsp;ft) tsunami.<ref name=\"iitk.ac.in\"/>\n\nThe worst affected area in [[Tamil Nadu]] was [[Nagapattinam district]], with a reported 6,051 fatalities caused by a 5&nbsp;m (16.4&nbsp;ft) tsunami, followed by Cuddalore district, with many villages destroyed.<ref name=\"iitk.ac.in\"/> The 13&nbsp;km (8.1 miles) Marina Beach in [[Chennai]] was battered by the tsunami which swept across the beach taking morning walkers unaware. Besides that, a 10&nbsp;m (33&nbsp;ft) black muddy tsunami reportedly ravaged the city of [[Karaikal]], where 492 lives were lost. The city of [[Pondicherry]], protected by seawalls relatively escaped unscathed in comparison to other areas in the state.<ref name=\"iitk.ac.in\"/>\n\nAt the same time, many villages from many districts at the state of [[Andhra Pradesh]] were destroyed. In the Krishna district, the tsunami created havoc in Manginapudi and on Machalipattanam Beach, which came like a running wall at the latter. The most affected was Prakasham District, recording 35 deaths, with maximum damage at Singraikonda, a beautiful beach hamlet.<ref name=\"iitk.ac.in\"/>\n\nGiven the enormous power of the tsunami, the fishing industry suffered the greatest. Moreover, the cost of damage in the transport sector was reported in the tens of thousands.<ref name=\"iitk.ac.in\"/> Many buildings and infrastructures near the coast were obliterated.\n\nConclusively, the tsunami effects varied greatly across different parts of the coast according to the number of waves experienced, the inundation distance and height of waves, and the population density of the area, as well as topological and geographical features that made some areas\nmore vulnerable than others. Besides these factors, the number of lives lost was influenced by exposure to previous disasters and the local disaster management capability. Most of the people killed were members of the fishing community and, in some cases such as [[Marina Beach]] at [[Chennai]] and Velankanni in [[Nagapattinam]], they were visitors on the beach.<ref name=\"iitk.ac.in\"/>\n\n===Maldives===\nThe tsunami of 26 December 2004 severely affected the [[Maldives]] at a distance of 2,500&nbsp;km (1553.4 miles) from the [[epicenter]] of the magnitude 9.0 earthquake. Identically to [[Sri Lanka]], survivors reported three waves with the second wave being the most powerful.<ref name=\"faculty.vassar.edu\"/> Being rich in coral reefs, the [[Maldives]] provides an opportunity for scientists to assess the impact of a tsunami on [[coral]] [[atolls]]. The significantly lower tsunami impact on the Maldives compared to [[Sri Lanka]] is largely due to the topography and [[bathymetry]] of the atoll chain with offshore coral reefs, deep channels separating individual atolls and its arrival within low tide which decreased the power of the tsunami. After the tsunami, there were some concern that the country might be totally submerged and become uninhabitable. However, this was proven untrue.<ref>http://faculty.vassar.edu/brmcadoo/EERI_Maldives_FzSyMcCa3.pdf</ref>\n\nThe largest tsunami wave measured was 4&nbsp;m (13.1&nbsp;ft) at Vilufushi Island (Thaa Atoll). The tsunami arrived approximately 2 hours after the earthquake. The greatest tsunami inundation occurred at North Male Atoll, Male island at 250 m (0.155 miles) along the streets.<ref name=\"faculty.vassar.edu\"/>\n\nThe Maldives tsunami wave analysis:<ref name=\"faculty.vassar.edu\"/>\n\n* 1.3 m-2.4 m (4.27&nbsp;ft–7.87&nbsp;ft) at North Male Atoll, Male Island.\n* 2&nbsp;m (6.56&nbsp;ft) at North Male Atoll, Huhule Island.\n* 1.7 m-2.8 m (5.58&nbsp;ft–9.2&nbsp;ft) at South Male Atoll, Embudhu Finothu.\n* 2.5 m-3.3 m (8.2&nbsp;ft–10.8&nbsp;ft) at Laamu Atoll, Fonadhoo Island.\n* 2.2 m-2.9 m (7.2&nbsp;ft–9.51&nbsp;ft) at Laamu Atoll, Gan Island.\n* 2.3 m-3 m (7.5&nbsp;ft–9.8&nbsp;ft) at North Male Atoll, Dhiffushi Island.\n* 2.2 m-2.4 m (7.2&nbsp;ft–7.87&nbsp;ft) at North Male Atoll, Huraa Island.\n* more than 1.5&nbsp;m (4.92&nbsp;ft) at North Male Atoll, Kuda Huraa Island.\n\n===Myanmar===\nIn [[Myanmar]], the tsunami caused only moderate damage, which arrived between 2 and 5.5 hours after the earthquake. Although the country's western [[Andaman Sea]] coastline lies at the proximity of the rupture zone, there were smaller tsunamis than the neighboring Thai coast, probably because the main tsunami source did not extend to the Andaman Islands. Another factor is that some coasts of [[Taninthayi Division]] was protected by offshore islands of the [[Myeik Archipelago]]. Based on scientific surveys from Ayeyarwaddy Delta through Taninthayi Division, it is revealed that tsunami heights along the Myanmar coast were between 0.4–2.9 m (1.3–9.5&nbsp;ft). Eyewitnesses often compared the December tsunami heights with the “rainy season high tide”; although at most locations, the tsunami height was similar or smaller than the “rainy season high tide” level.<ref name=\"terrapub.co.jp\">https://www.terrapub.co.jp/journals/EPS/pdf/2006/5802/58020243.pdf</ref>\n\nTsunami survey heights:\n\n* 0.6 m-2.3 m (1.97&nbsp;ft–7.54&nbsp;ft) around the Ayeyarwady delta.\n* 0.9 m-2.9 m (2.95&nbsp;ft–9.5&nbsp;ft) at [[Dawei]] area.\n* 0.7 m-2.2 m (2.3&nbsp;ft–7.2&nbsp;ft) around [[Myeik, Burma|Myeik]].\n* 0.4 m-2.6 m (1.3&nbsp;ft–8.5&nbsp;ft) around [[Kawthaung]].\n\nInterviews with local people indicate that they did not feel the earthquake in [[Taninthayi Division]] or in Ayeyarwaddy Delta. The 71 casualties can be attributed to poor housing infrastructure and additionally, the fact that the coastal residents in the surveyed areas live on flat land along the coast, especially in the Ayeyarwaddy Delta, and that there is no higher ground to evacuate. The tsunami heights from the 2004 December earthquake\nwere not more than 3&nbsp;m (9.8&nbsp;ft) along the Myanmar coast, the amplitudes are slightly large off the Ayeyarwaddy Delta, probably because the shallow delta cause a concentration in tsunami energy.<ref name=\"terrapub.co.jp\"/>\n\n===Somalia===\nThe [[tsunami]] spawned from the [[megathrust earthquake]] near [[Sumatra]] travelled 5000&nbsp;km (3106.86 miles) west across the open ocean before striking the East African country of [[Somalia]]. Around 289 fatalities were reported in the [[Horn of Africa]], drowned by four tsunami waves. The hardest hit was a 650&nbsp;km (403.9 miles) stretch of the Somalia coastline between Garacad ([[Mudug]] region) and Xaafuun ([[Bari]] region), which forms part of the [[Puntland]] Province. Most of the victims were reported along the low-lying Xaafuun Peninsula.<ref name=\"2004tsunami.ce.gatech.edu\">http://2004tsunami.ce.gatech.edu/publications/som_eqs_v22-iS3_106607eqs.pdf</ref> The Puntland coast in northern Somalia was by far the area hardest hit by the waves to the west of the Indian subcontinent. The waves arrived around noon local time.<ref name=\"2004tsunami.ce.gatech.edu\"/>\n\nConsequently, tsunami runup heights vary from 5&nbsp;m (16.4&nbsp;ft) to 9&nbsp;m (29.5&nbsp;ft) with inundation distances varying from 44 m (0.027 miles) to 704 m (0.44 miles). The maximum runup height of almost 9&nbsp;m (29.5&nbsp;ft) was recorded in Bandarbeyla. An even higher runup point was measured on a [[cliff]] near the town of Eyl, solely on an eyewitness account.\n\nThe highest death toll was in Xaafuun, also known as [[Hafun]], with 19 bodies and 160 people presumed missing out of its 5000 inhabitants, which amounts to the highest number of casualties in a single African town and the largest tsunami death toll in a single town to the west of the [[Indian subcontinent]]. In Xaafuun, small drawbacks were observed before the third and most powerful tsunami flood the town.<ref name=\"2004tsunami.ce.gatech.edu\"/>\n\nNumerous fishing boats and buildings were also devastated.\n\n===Elsewhere in the Indian Ocean===\nThe [[tsunami]] also reached [[Malaysia]], mainly on the northern states such as [[Kedah]], [[Perak]] and [[Penang]] and on offshore islands such as [[Langkawi|Langkawi island]]. [[Peninsular Malaysia]] was shielded by the full force of the tsunami due to the protection offered by the island of [[Sumatra]], which lies just off the western coast.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.smh.com.au/news/Asia-Tsunami/Tsunami-death-toll-passes-283000/2005/01/27/1106415737181.html|title=Tsunami death toll passes 283,000 – Asia Tsunami – www.smh.com.au|publisher=}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Tanjungtokongwave.png|thumbnail|Tsunami flooding the streets of Tanjung Tokong, [[George Town, Penang|George Town]], [[Penang]].]]\n\nIn [[Bangladesh]], located on the northern [[Bay of Bengal]] escaped major damage and deaths because the water displaced by the [[strike-slip fault]] was relatively little on the northern section of the rupture zone, which ruptured slowly.

In total, eight people in South Africa died due to abnormally high sea levels and waves.\n\nRelief agencies reported that one-third of the dead appeared to be children. This was a result of the high proportion of children in the populations of many of the affected regions and because children were the least able to resist being overcome by the surging waters. [[Oxfam]] went on to report that as many as four times more women than men were killed in some regions because they were waiting on the beach for the fishermen to return and looking after their children in the houses.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/asia-pacific/4383573.stm|title=Most tsunami dead female – Oxfam|publisher=BBC News|date=26 March 2005|accessdate=24 December 2012}}</ref>\n\nIn addition to the large number of local residents, up to 9,000&nbsp;foreign tourists (mostly Europeans) enjoying the peak holiday travel season were among the dead or missing, especially people from the [[Nordic countries]]. The European nation hardest hit may have been [[Sweden]], whose death toll was 543. [[Germany]] was close behind with 539 identified victims.

The United Nations estimated at the outset that the relief operation would be the costliest in human history. Then-[[UN Secretary-General]] [[Kofi Annan]] stated that reconstruction would probably take between five and ten years. Governments and non-governmental organisations feared that the final [[death toll]] might double as a result of diseases, prompting a massive [[humanitarian response to the 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake|humanitarian response]]. In the end, this fear did not materialise.\n\nFor purposes of establishing timelines of local events, the [[time zone]]s of affected areas are: UTC+3: (Kenya, Madagascar, Somalia, Tanzania); UTC+4: (Mauritius, Réunion, Seychelles); UTC+5: (Maldives); UTC+5:30: (India, Sri Lanka); UTC+6: (Bangladesh); UTC+6:30: (Cocos Islands, Myanmar); UTC+7: (Indonesia (western), Thailand); UTC+8: (Malaysia, Singapore).

There had been reports and rumors that the local aid workers had been killed.\n\n==Impact==\n===Economic impacts===\nThe level of damage to the economy resulting from the tsunami depends on the scale examined. While local economies were devastated, the overall impact to the national economies was minor. The two main occupations affected by the tsunami were fishing and tourism.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Gunatillake|first=Daya|title=The 2004 Tsunami in Sri Lanka: Destruction and recovery|journal=Geography|year=2007|volume=92|issue=3|pages=285–293|jstor=40574342}}</ref> The impact on [[Fisheries#Fisheries and communities|coastal fishing communities]] and the people living there, some of the poorest in the region, has been devastating with high losses of [[income earner]]s as well as boats and fishing gear.<ref>Staff Writer. \"[http://www.ukabc.org/tsunamis.htm Indian Ocean Tsunamis Devastate Fisherfolk].\" UK Agricultural Biodiversity Coalition. 26 December 2004.</ref> In Sri Lanka artisanal fishery, where the use of fish baskets, fishing traps, and spears are commonly used, is an important source of fish for local markets; industrial fishery is the major economic activity, providing direct employment to about 250,000 people. In recent years the fishery industry has emerged as a dynamic export-oriented sector, generating substantial foreign exchange earnings. Preliminary estimates indicate that 66% of the fishing fleet and industrial infrastructure in coastal regions have been destroyed by the wave surges, which will have adverse economic effects both at local and national levels.<ref>Staff Writer. \"Food Supply and Food Security Situation in Countries Affected by the Asia Tsunami.\" Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations. 14 January 2005.</ref>\n\nWhile the tsunami destroyed many of the boats vital to Sri Lanka's fishing industry, it also created demand for fiberglass reinforced plastic [[catamaran]]s in boatyards of [[Tamil Nadu]]. Since over 51,000 vessels were lost to the tsunami, the industry boomed. However, the huge demand has led to lower quality in the process, and some important materials were sacrificed to cut prices for those who were impoverished by the tsunami.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bobpigo.org/bbn/sep_06/pages10-12.pdf |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5tul4D7Pz?url=http://www.bobpigo.org/bbn/sep_06/pages10-12.pdf |archivedate=1 November 2010 |title=Demand for FRP boats rise after tsunami |format=PDF |accessdate=12 August 2010 |deadurl=no |df=dmy }}</ref>\n\nBut some economists believe that damage to the affected national economies will be minor because losses in the tourism and fishing industries are a relatively small percentage of the GDP. However, others caution that damage to infrastructure is an overriding factor. In some areas drinking water supplies and farm fields may have been contaminated for years by salt water from the ocean.<ref>Pearce, Fred. \"[https://www.newscientist.com/article.ns?id=dn6840 Tsunami's salt water may leave islands uninhabitable].\" ''[[New Scientist]].'' 5 January 2005. {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080422084629/http://www.newscientist.com/article.ns?id=dn6840 |date=22 April 2008 }}</ref> Even though only coastal regions were directly affected by the waters of the tsunami, the indirect effects have spread to inland provinces as well. Since the media coverage of the event was so extensive, many tourists cancelled vacations and trips to that part of the world, even though their travel destinations may not have been affected. This ripple effect could especially be felt in the inland provinces of Thailand, such as Krabi, which acted like a starting point for many other tourist destinations in Thailand.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Rigg|first=Johnathan|author2=Lisa Lawt |author3=May Tan-Mullins |author4=Carl Grundy-Warr|title=The Indian Ocean Tsunami: Socio-Economic Impacts in Thailand.|journal=The Geographic Journal|date=December 2005|volume=171|issue=4|pages=374–379|jstor=3451210|doi=10.1111/j.1475-4959.2005.00175_3.x}}</ref>\n\nBoth the earthquake and the tsunami may have affected shipping in the [[Malacca Straits]], which separate Malaysia and the Indonesian island of Sumatra, by changing the depth of the seabed and by disturbing navigational buoys and old shipwrecks.

In addition, the spread of solid and liquid waste and industrial chemicals, [[water pollution]] and the destruction of [[sewage]] collectors and treatment plants threaten the environment even further, in untold ways. The environmental impact will take a long time and significant resources to assess.<ref>Staff Writer. \"[http://www.oceansatlas.org/id/71687 Impact of Tsunamis on Ecosystems].\" ''UN Atlas of the Oceans''. Retrieved 10 March 2005.</ref>\n\nAccording to specialists, the main effect is being caused by poisoning of the [[freshwater]] supplies and of the soil by [[seawater|saltwater]] infiltration and a deposit of a salt layer over arable land. It has been reported that in the Maldives, 16 to 17 coral reef atolls that were overcome by sea waves are completely without fresh water and could be rendered uninhabitable for decades. Uncountable wells that served communities were invaded by sea, sand, and earth; and [[aquifer]]s were invaded through porous rock. Salted-over soil becomes sterile, and it is difficult and costly to restore for agriculture. It also causes the death of plants and important soil micro-organisms. Thousands of rice, mango, and banana plantations in Sri Lanka were destroyed almost entirely and will take years to recover. On the island's east coast, the tsunami contaminated wells on which many villagers relied for drinking water. The Colombo-based [[International Water Management Institute]] monitored the effects of saltwater and concluded that the wells recovered to pre-tsunami drinking water quality one and a half years after the event.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20120302022712/http://www.iwmi.cgiar.org/Publications/Success_Stories/PDF/2010/Issue%207%20-%20Helping_restore_the_quality_of_drinking_water_after_the_tsunami.pdf Helping restore the quality of drinking water after the tsunami.] [[International Water Management Institute]], 2010.

Photo- AusAID (10730863873).jpg|300px|thumbnail|Tsunami aftermath in [[Aceh]], [[Indonesia]]]]\n\n;Psychological trauma\nMany health professionals and aid workers have reported widespread psychological trauma associated with the tsunami. Traditional beliefs in many of the affected regions state that a relative of the family must bury the body of the dead, and in many cases, no body remained to be buried. Women in Aceh required a special approach from foreign aid agencies, and continue to have unique needs.\n\n;Conflicts and a cease-fire\nThe hardest hit area, [[Aceh]], is considered to be a religiously conservative Islamic society and has had no tourism nor any Western presence in recent years due to [[Insurgency in Aceh|armed conflict]] between the [[Indonesian military]] and [[Free Aceh Movement|Acehnese separatists]]. Some believe that the tsunami was divine punishment for lay Muslims shirking their daily prayers and/or following a materialistic lifestyle. Others have said that [[Allah]] was angry that there were Muslims killing other Muslims in an ongoing conflict.<ref>Broadway, Bill. \"[https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A57758-2005Jan7.html Divining a Reason for Devastation].\" ''[[The Washington Post]]''. 8 January 2005.</ref> Saudi cleric [[Muhammad Al-Munajjid]] attributed it to divine retribution against non-Muslim vacationers \"who used to sprawl all over the beaches and in pubs overflowing with wine\" during Christmas break.<ref>[http://www.baylor.edu/pr/index.php?id=25982 Associated Press – Tsunami survivors cling tightly to faith across ravaged region] by Brian Murphy, January 2005</ref>\n\nThe widespread devastation caused by the tsunami led the main rebel group [[Free Aceh Movement|GAM]] to declare a cease-fire on 28 December 2004 followed by the Indonesian government, and the two groups resumed long-stalled peace talks, which resulted in a peace agreement signed 15 August 2005.

The hardest hit country outside Asia, 543 Swedish tourists, mainly in Thailand, died. With no single incident having killed more Swedish people since the [[battle of Poltava]] in 1709, the [[cabinet of Göran Persson]] was heavily criticized for lack of action.\n\n;Tsunami warning system\n[[Smith Dharmasaroja]], a meteorologist who predicted the tsunami before it hit, was assigned the development of the Thai tsunami warning system. The Indian Ocean Tsunami warning system was formed in early 2005 immediately after the tragedy of 26 December 2004 to provide an early warning of tsunamis for inhabitants around the Indian Ocean coasts.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ioc-tsunami.org/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=74&Itemid=278&lang=en|title=TWFP|publisher=}}</ref>\n\n;Effect on the Earth\nThe changes in the distribution of masses inside the Earth due to the earthquake had several consequences.
