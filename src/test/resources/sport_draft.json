[[National Basketball Association]] (NBA) teams took turns selecting amateur U.S. [[college basketball]] players and other eligible players, including international players.\n\nThe [[NBA draft lottery|draft lottery]] took place during the playoffs on May 16, 2017. The 53–29 [[Boston Celtics]], who were also the #1 seed in the [[Eastern Conference (NBA)|Eastern Conference]] and reached the [[2017 NBA Playoffs|Eastern Conference Finals]] at the time of the NBA draft lottery, won the #1 pick with pick swapping rights thanks to a previous trade with the [[Brooklyn Nets]], who had the worst record the previous season. The [[Los Angeles Lakers]], who had risked losing their 2017 first round pick to the [[Philadelphia 76ers]], moved up two spots to get the No. 2 pick, while Philadelphia moved up to receive the No. 3 pick due to the [[Sacramento Kings]] moving up in the draft, which activated pick swapping rights the 76ers had from an earlier trade. On June 19, four days before the NBA draft began, the Celtics and 76ers traded their top first round picks to each other, meaning the holders of the top four picks of this year's draft would be exactly the same as the previous year's draft.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.celticsblog.com/2017/6/19/15831962/nba-draft-celtics-officially-trade-number-one-pick-to-76ers-philadelphia-boston-fultz-tatum|title=NBA Draft: Celtics officially trade number-one pick to 76ers|publisher=|accessdate=June 23, 2017}}</ref>\n\nThe draft class is the youngest draft class ever, with the most freshmen and fewest seniors selected in the first round; the top seven picks in the draft were all college freshmen. It was the third time, and the second in a row, that three players were selected from [[Serbia]]n team [[KK Mega Basket]] in the same draft ([[Vlatko Čančar]], [[Ognjen Jaramaz]], [[Alpha Kaba]]), with it previously occurring during the [[2014 NBA draft|2014]] and [[2016 NBA draft]].

The CBA that ended the [[2011 NBA Lockout|2011 lockout]] instituted no immediate changes to the draft, but called for a committee of owners and players to discuss future changes.\n\n* All drafted players must be at least 19 years old during the calendar year of the draft. In terms of dates, players who are eligible for the 2017 draft, must be born on or before December 31, 1998.\n* On January 13, 2016, the [[NCAA Division I]] council approved a new rule for that division that significantly changed the draft landscape for college players:<ref>{{cite news|url=http://espn.go.com/mens-college-basketball/story/_/id/14564613/date-nba-draft-commitment-pushed-may |title=College players given extra time to mull NBA draft decision |first=Jeff |last=Goodman |publisher=''ESPN.com'' |date=January 13, 2016 |accessdate=January 13, 2016}}</ref>\n** Declaration for the draft no longer results in automatic loss of college eligibility. As long as a player does not sign a contract with a professional team outside the NBA, or sign with an agent, he will retain college eligibility as long as he makes a timely withdrawal from the draft.\n** NCAA players now have until 10 days after the end of the [[NBA Draft Combine]] to withdraw from the draft. Since the combine is held in mid-May, the current deadline is about five weeks after the previous mid-April deadline.\n** NCAA players may participate in the draft combine, and will also be allowed to attend one tryout per year with each NBA team without losing college eligibility.\n** NCAA players may now enter and withdraw from the draft up to two times without loss of eligibility. Previously, the NCAA treated a second declaration of draft eligibility as a permanent loss of college eligibility.\n\nThe NBA has since expanded the draft combine to include players with remaining college eligibility (who, like players without college eligibility, can only attend by invitation).<ref>{{cite news|url=http://espn.go.com/mens-college-basketball/story/_/id/13142145/ncaa-proposes-new-nba-draft-rule-allow-underclassmen-return-school |title=NCAA proposes new NBA draft rule to allow early entrants back in school |first=Andy |last=Katz |authorlink=Andy Katz |publisher=''ESPN.com'' |date=June 24, 2015 |accessdate=June 24, 2015}}</ref>\n\n===Early entrants===\nPlayers who are not automatically eligible had to declare their eligibility for the draft by notifying the NBA offices in writing no later than 60 days before the draft. For the 2017 draft, this date fell on April 23. After that date \"early entry\" players were able to attend NBA pre-draft camps and individual team workouts to show off their skills and obtain feedback regarding their draft positions. Under the CBA a player may withdraw his name from consideration from the draft at any time before the final declaration date, which is 10 days before the draft. Under current NCAA rules, players have until May 24 (10 days after the draft combine) to withdraw from the draft and retain college eligibility.\n\nA player who has hired an agent forfeits his remaining college eligibility regardless of whether he is drafted.\n\n====College underclassmen====\nA record-high 185 underclass draft prospects (i.e., players with remaining college eligibility) had declared themselves for eligibility at the April 24 deadline (138 of them being from college), although college players who had not hired agents or signed professional contracts outside the NBA were able to decide to return to college by May 24, 10 days after the end of the [[NBA Draft Combine]]. These players have publicly indicated that they have hired agents, or had planned to do so around the start of the draft; those who hired agents immediately lost their eligibility to return to NCAA basketball in 2017–18.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.nba.com/article/2017/04/25/nba-announces-early-entry-candidates-2017-nba-draft |title=NBA announces early entry candidates for 2017 NBA Draft |accessdate=May 18, 2017}}</ref> By the end of the May 24 deadline, 73 draft candidates from college decided to return to their respective colleges for at least another year, leaving 64 underclassmen to officially enter the draft this year.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nba.com/article/2017/05/25/nba-announces-early-entry-candidates-withdraw-2017-nba-draft|title=NBA announces early entry candidates withdraw for 2017 NBA Draft|first=Official|last=release|website=NBA.com|accessdate=June 23, 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://nba.nbcsports.com/2017/05/25/after-73-underclassmen-pull-out-of-nba-draft-here-are-the-final-early-entries/|title=After 73 underclassmen pull out of NBA draft, here are the final early entries|first=Kurt|last=Helin|date=May 25, 2017|publisher=|accessdate=June 23, 2017}}</ref> Additionally, two more players left entry at the end of the international player deadline, meaning both [[Maverick Rowan]] from North Carolina State and [[Darin Johnson]] from Cal State Northridge would not return for college, but one player managed to enter the college underclassman deadline, thus leaving 63 entries at hand for the NBA Draft.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nba.com/article/2017/06/13/nba-draft-36-early-entry-international-candidates-withdraw|title=Thirty-six international early entry NBA Draft candidates withdraw|first=Official|last=release|website=NBA.com|accessdate=June 23, 2017}}</ref>\n\n{{Div col|colwidth=30em}}\n*{{flagicon|USA}} [[Bam Adebayo]] – F, [[Kentucky Wildcats men's basketball|Kentucky]] (freshman)\n*{{flagicon|USA}} [[Jarrett Allen]] – F, [[Texas Longhorns men's basketball|Texas]] (freshman)\n*{{flagicon|USA}} [[Ike Anigbogu]] – F, [[UCLA Bruins men's basketball|UCLA]] (freshman)\n*{{flagicon|ENG}}/{{flagicon|NGA}} [[OG Anunoby]] – F, [[Indiana Hoosiers men's basketball|Indiana]] (sophomore)\n*{{flagicon|USA}} [[Dwayne Bacon]] – G, [[Florida State Seminoles men's basketball|Florida State]] (sophomore)\n*{{flagicon|USA}} [[Lonzo Ball]] – G, [[UCLA Bruins men's basketball|UCLA]] (freshman)\n*{{flagicon|USA}} [[Jordan Bell]] – F, [[Oregon Ducks men's basketball|Oregon]] (junior)\n*{{flagicon|USA}} [[James Blackmon Jr.]] – G, [[Indiana Hoosiers men's basketball|Indiana]] (junior)\n*{{flagicon|USA}} [[Antonio Blakeney]] – G, [[LSU Tigers men's basketball|LSU]] (sophomore)\n*{{flagicon|USA}} [[Tony Bradley (basketball)|Tony Bradley]] – F, [[North Carolina Tar Heels men's basketball|North Carolina]] (freshman)\n*{{flagicon|USA}} [[Isaiah Briscoe]] – G, [[Kentucky Wildcats men's basketball|Kentucky]] (sophomore)\n*{{flagicon|CAN}} [[Dillon Brooks]] – F, [[Oregon Ducks men's basketball|Oregon]] (junior)\n*{{flagicon|USA}} [[Thomas Bryant (basketball)|Thomas Bryant]] – C, [[Indiana Hoosiers men's basketball|Indiana]] (sophomore)\n*{{flagicon|USA}} [[Clandell Cetoute]] – F, [[Thiel College]] (junior)\n*{{flagicon|USA}} [[John Collins (basketball)|John Collins]] – F, [[Wake Forest Demon Deacons men's basketball|Wake Forest]] (sophomore)\n*{{flagicon|USA}} [[Zach Collins]] – F/C, [[Gonzaga Bulldogs men's basketball|Gonzaga]] (freshman)\n*{{flagicon|USA}} [[Chance Comanche]] – C, [[Arizona Wildcats men's basketball|Arizona]] (sophomore)\n*{{flagicon|USA}}/{{flagicon|GRE}} [[Tyler Dorsey]] – G, [[Oregon Ducks men's basketball|Oregon]] (sophomore)\n*{{flagicon|USA}} [[P.
